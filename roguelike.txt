I have played the PalmOS version of Rogue.

This is a game famous for starting or influencing multiple genres, but most people have not actually played it. 
I think that every roguelike fan should try, just to see whether it matches their idea of what Rogue is!

AKA LDC
BY Linley Henzell
BY country: Australia
This is one of the best roguelikes. It has evolved into {Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup}. Some changes that DCSS developers did are 
criticized by the fans of the original. For example, LDC has a very good food system, which connects to other systems of the game
(magic costs food, god powers cost food, some races need no food or different kinds of food, amulets may change your food needs, 
some food has magical effects, some gods require sacrifices of corpses so you won't be able to eat them, butchering corpses for
food needs a blade so you cannot do that if you wield a cursed non-blade weapon, etc.) while DCSS has recently removed this whole
system. LDC had lots of flavor that did not affect the gameplay that much but made the game feel more like an adventure, like 
mimics or the standard fantasy races -- these have been removed in favor of a higher focus on gameplay. They also did lots of
great improvements, so it is probably better to play DCSS, but LDC has lots of flavor of its own.

BY community
This is one of the best roguelikes, that clearly sits in the top of the "best" rankings in the roguelike community for the last 20 years.
Nevertheless, it appears to be basically unknown outside of the community, so I think it deserves 3 gem points. The only drawback
is that apparently people who have started their roguelike adventure with DCSS consider it a model roguelike, including its 
amazing run-based strategic risk management, and did not complain as strongly about other randomized permadeath games being called roguelike as
more experience players who know older roguelikes such as {ADOM} were not really about permadeath...

Anyway, it is great at not wasting the player's time due to its design: anti-grind philosophy (which means that the optimal way to play the game
should be also the most fun), anti-spoiler philosophy (you do not need to refer to knowledge found in wikis or obtained by experimentation
in earlier games), automation features (if you do not feel like exploring personally or fighting easy monsters you can automatize that).
It has very good procedural generation, with various levels feeling different. It has very good, strategical permadeath: there are lots
of consumables that you can apply before the fight to make yourself stronger, so you need to know whether to use a consumable, and which
one. 
It is a variant of {Linley's Dungeon Crawl}, some changes have been heavily criticized by the community, although it is probably
better to play DCSS.

I do not like NetHack that much -- I finished it without observing permadeath and I did not want to go for an actual victority. 
The interface and design seems very dated (I have played it afer {ADOM}).
On the other hand, "hacklikes", or games heavily inspired by NetHack, are among the best early roguelikes in my
opinion. These include {ADOM}, {Valhalla}, {IVAN}, and {PRIME}. Nevertheless, there are lots of great things about NetHack that other
hacklikes did not replicate, like its approach to unexpected interactions (aka "The Dev Team Thought Of Everything").

AKA ADOM
In the {GSNband} readme I have found some references to another roguelike called {ADOM}, and it looked interesting. {Valhalla} and
{GSNband} had graphical tiles, while ADOM had only the ASCII display; it took me some time to bring myself to play that, and then
to appreciate it, but it was definitely worth the effort. A very complex, hacklike RPG, with a detailed world and lots of mysteries.
I got a savescumming victory at first, with a Wizard, then played necromancers, mindcrafters and archers permadeath.
As far as I know, I was the first person to legally obtain the Platinum Girdle (legally, as in, without savescumming or other
form of in-game cheating -- I had to "code dive" to discover what the actual rules were).

Later I became a member of the ADOM DevTeam, responsible for programming the graphics interface. So you no longer need to bring
yourself to appreciate ASCII to play ADOM, or mostly any other good roguelike.

It is a bit of conflict of interest, but I think ADOM deserves a positive gem score because it is one of the most influential classic roguelikes that seems to be rarely
talked about nowadays. It also seems that modern players do not understand it. They try to play it as a permadeath game, while (from a glance at historical
Usenet posts) in the past, most people savescummed, at least to learn the game. I would generally recommend the mindset "roguelikes are not about permadeath, play the game however you want".
I think the most fun way is to play some non-permadeath runs to learn the game, then read the spoiler guides to learn the secrets you missed, and try permadeath after that. Maybe taste
some permadeath first too.

This is the first game I played that was called roguelike. (I played {Ragnarok} before but I did not know it was a roguelike.)
One of my classmates has found it on a CD attached to some magazine, containing many free games, and quite a lot of us got obsessed with it.

It is a variant of {ZAngband}, that was itself a variant of {Angband}.
However, while ZAngband is based on the works of Roger Zelazny, GSNband returns to the Tolkien world. It also includes some features
from other Angband variants. Contrary to the base Angband, GSNband features a simple overworld (basically not only the town "level"
but also wilderness levels and with multiple towns to visit), and some predesigned quests available in towns and wilderness.
Overall, a very complex and very good game, although after playing more games with more hacklike design (zones persistent and fitting
on the screen or infinite, complex interactions, etc.), I preferred those. I do not remember whether I have won it without
savescumming.

This game takes Doom and changes its genre to roguelike. I consider it a very important contribution to the history of video gaming,
being one of the first "coffeebreak roguelikes", the games that did show that it was possible to make a short roguelike, in the
times when most roguelike developers were trying to create {ADOM} but bigger. (As we all know, today, the overwhelming majority of
games in the family started by Rogue are short -- although the biggest ones are still big, both in the traditional roguelike circles,
and in mainstream, with e.g. {Minecraft}.) It also introduced an amazing system of
turn-based dodging. A great game that I highly recommend. See also {Jupiter Hell} and {Jupiter Hell Classic}.

Brogue is one of the most popular games in the roguelike community, and it is considered one of the most similar to Rogue.
However, I think that this similarity is a bit overrated: there are still substantial improvements and differences. In Rogue
you only descend, in Brogue you can go up and down; Brogue is highly focused on using enchantment scrolls to create your
"build". Brogue has procedurally generated "puzzles". And so on. Brogue is an influential game by itself, having inspired {Unexplored} and {Pixel Dungeon}.
The version I have played was AFAIK solodev, but I think people play the community edition BrogueCE, so it counts as {by:community} development.

AKA IVAN
A Finnish hacklike with some innovative features, such as a system of fluids which could cover equipment and gases,
and showing equipment on the characters. Lots of humor that I actually found funny (as opposed to the kitchensink
humor of NetHack). I was very active in the IVAN forums at some point, created "IVAN3D" which was a mod featuring
first-person perspective graphics, took part in the IVANcon (a real-world meeting of IVAN fans in Finland), and got the major victory. 
It has a design flaw: what enemies you meet depends on your current power, so becoming strong is not necessarily
a great strategy. This can be gamed by pretending to be less powerful than you actually are (for example,
entering new levels not wearing your powerful armor). (It is explained that displaing expensive loot attracts the
attention of more powerful enemies.)

AKA Dredmore
Some people think that the reason why roguelikes are not popular is their poor graphics -- Dungeons of Dredmor got nice
graphics (for its time) and I think it actually was one of the most popular indie games at the time, so it seems to
support this hypothesis, although I feel it was like the only example. ({Caves of Qud} got very popular recently
although that happened despite rather simple graphics.)

It is solid and quite good, with an interesting class system -- I think you select 7 classes at the start (possibly
randomly) and then you can learn more and more advanced skills from these classes. I think it is worth playing,
although it did not feel that special to me to win it with permadeath. Unfortunately the devs' next game was
too ambitious and went broke, although I think there was some attempt at revival recently?

For some weird reason the title is often misspelled as Dredmore.

This game combines the roguelike gameplay (and many other inspirations from roguelikes, mostly the {Angband} branch)
with a fixed map, which is a rather rare combination. It focuses a lot on playing a handcrafted story, you can even
buy the story in a book form. Instead of permadeath, when you die, you "wake up from a nightmare" in the last inn
where you saved the game.

Despite the lack of permadeath, this is a very hardcore game. The distances between checkpoints tend to be rather large.
The enemies are very dangerous. The inventory space is small, and the equipment is often destructible, so it is hard
to carry stuff to protect against all possible dangers. In lots of places you need to do unobvious things to proceed,
so you will probably need to buy the story to get some hints. While, in my opinion, a roguelike does not need to be
procedurally generated, Legerdemain shows that it is definitely much harder to create one with fixed maps. After dying,
you are likely to explore the same maps again. While the monsters are different, exploring the same maps again is boring.
I have finished it, but with some cheats. It is a very interesting game, but I think a less hardcore version would
attract more fans.

TAGCMT free
It is a free game but the hint book is paid, and it is unlikely to be able to go far without it.

PNG alphaman Fighting Donald Trump
A roguelike based on American pop culture. You are in post-apocalyptic New York City, that is a huge map constructed
out of many screens, you have multiple castles to visit. 
One interesting thing about it is that it contains
Donald Trump as a boss whom you have to fight to obtain the "presidential ID card". So it basicaly predicted Trump's
presidency in 1995. 

You randomly get two mutations, one physical and one mental,
although I have been start scumming to get the <i>Scientific Genius</i> mutation which allows to construct devices
out of scrap. There are lots of cool tech devices to find.
It appears that {Caves of Qud} took some inspiration from it -- regarding the devices that you have
to identify, that are also easy to create with the right skill, and many of which are grenades. One more interesting
thing is the berries -- they are the analog of the usual roguelike potions with shuffled names, but they go through 6
levels of ripeness and 3 levels of concentration. I think I have won it with permadeath (although not sure -- the
game does not even enforce permadeath itself). Overall, an old roguelike with a unique theme.

This was the first roguelike I have played, although I did not know that it was a roguelike then. As the saying goes, "the first
roguelike you play defines what you think a roguelike is", and well, Valhalla had graphical GUI, it was not restricted to 
dungeons, and its permadeath was optional. From the point of view of a more experienced roguelike player, all these elements
were an improvement. The starting area, the forest, was very cool -- it was not just randomly placed trees, I think it generated
a typical roguelike dungeon and changed rooms into clearings and walls into trees. Some later areas were nice too, like
Slaeter's Sea or Niflheim. At the startup you pick between the "beginner" mode and the "expert" mode, only the expert mode has
permadeath, but the "beginner" mode has potential to cause your next character find multiple ghosts of the current one, 
which was a subtle nudge that you should rather play permadeath. (More because finding multiple inventories felt like an exploit
than because the ghosts were challenging.) The graphics featured a small 7x7 zoomed-in area with detailed graphics and
the symbolic map of the whole level (using ASCII for monsters). Speaking of ASCII, it was weird that, in some menu, you had to
press '!' to pick up all potions -- this only got obvious after playing other roguelikes. A very good game, that unfortunately
did not sell well.

Valhalla is a commercial port of the roguelike originally named Ragnarok. It has sounds, but somehow, lycantrophy does not
work correctly. There was also a newer version of Ragnarok, which no longer has sounds, and apparently no more beginner/expert
choice (you do not have to observe permadeath).

It appears that basically every time the buzzord meaning of "roguelike" changes there is a new "chess roguelike" which is very different
from the earlier iterations. ChessRogue is one that is actually like Rogue: procedurally generated chessboard, you play only as the
King. Originally you can move in 4 directions but then you gain more power as you defeat stronger and stronger pieces. Very good,
I consider it an inspiration for HyperRogue. One flaw was that you could lose by making a single move that puts you under attack --
obviously that is contrary to Chess, where there is a "checkmate rule" which says that such rules are disallowed.
HyperRogue fixes this flaw. I have won the original (3DRL?) version, I think it later added Unicode graphics and some fantasy pieces.

This is usually considered the first open-world roguelike, a predecessor to {ADOM}. Good to play if you are interested in roguelike
history, but probably better to try something newer otherwise. Has some interesting features like "play as yourself" (stats depending
on how you answer some questions), a complex inventory system (with "in the air" slot or something), and a complex combat system
(you can attack/lunge/riposte low/high or something like that).

This roguelike is similar to {Brogue}, so rather traditional. It is beautifully designed for mobiles, which is quite rare
(and innovative, I would say) in roguelikes. I have seen it have over 5M downloads in Google Play, so apparently one
of the most popular roguelikes. I have played the original but by now it seems to have been overshadowed by variants,
{Shattered Pixel Dungeon} is the most popular. It is good, although it has a reputation of being somewhat luck-based.

BY Freehold Games
This game should need no introduction -- in a recent "top 5 roguelikes" thread in r/roguelikes, Caves of Qud was mentioned most frequently.

When I started being involved in roguelike development, around 2000, I remember lots of very ambitious projects about games which used the simple presentation
and exploration/combat system of roguelikes to challenge the player's imagination and make very complex, simulationist gameplay possible. Like {ADOM}, but better.
Most of these developers never released anything... instead, eventually a counter-movement happened to actually release something, so we got lots of shorter
roguelikes, focused on balance, which are great in their own right, but something was missing.

Caves of Qud is like these old dreams, but successful. Very complex. Very epic. Lots of similarities to roguelike classics (the general structure similar
to ADOM, figuring out devices like in {Alphaman}). Amazing worldbuilding and writing. Hopefully it will inspire a new wave of great roguelikes.

I have some criticisms (calling its non-permadeath mode "roleplay" -- generally it seems that some people think of that mode as some kind of innovation while
most traditional roguelikes either have such modes or have traditionally been savescummed heavily --- and sometimes monsters on the level below just stop moving
and you can easily defeat them from above) but it definitely deserves the prizes it got.

TAGCMT oneofthree
I have decided to include "one of three" tag because, if you choose to get a new mutation, you are given a selection of random mutations.
However, this is a relatively minor aspect (you can pick anything you want for the "main" mutations of your build) and it is still somewhat controllable.

TAGCMT timebending
There are "precognition" and "temporal fugue" powers.

The notable thing about it is that it was actually a roguelike predating Rogue. With ASCII graphics (or optionally other graphics modes),

a great thing to do in roguelikes -- although my NotEye and {HyperRogue} although do very simple versions of it (and I think
NotEye did it before Jupiter Hell). ({Jupiter Hell Classic} is more of a modern version of DoomRL.)

In the overworld map you pick between one of three paths, and you are shown what items are there on every path, so this is essentially a choice between three upgrades and it technically
counts as "one of three". However, as far as I understand, you should have a choice of eventually getting every item, and the main upgrades are awarded for experience points from a huge list,
so I do not see it as much as a problem as usual.

This is one of the most popular roguelikes, with a long history going back to a variant of {Angband}, called "Troubles of Middle Earth",
later renamed to not annoy the Tolkien estate.
Lots of races and classes. Some interaction between runs (some classes need unlocking,
there is also a place where you could store stuff for a following character). It is one of the games with the biggest number
of achievements on Steam. Contrary to typical roguelikes, it greatly reduces the impact of resource management:
there are no (or almost no) consumables, as far as I recall. This removes one aspect of permadeath that makes it actually interesting
in games such as {DCSS} ("risk management", as in, resource management where risk is considered one of the resources, and you trade
other limited resources to reduce the risk). So it makes permadeath more of a "git gud" aspect. On the other hand, it gives more
weight to cooldowns -- most of the game is about using various race/class powers instead, which are limited by cooldowns.

The paid version allows to disable permadeath, but I have been playing the free version. My runs often ended because of attacks of
randomized unique monsters. I have been able to reach the second continent (or something) after disabling them, and I was not interested
enough to try playing anymore. So many other great roguelikes!

I have tried the 7DRL version, it was quite similar in style to {Dream Quest} or {Desktop Dungeons} -- the roguelikeness was
reduced to exploring a grid-based map, the tactics were replaced by puzzles, dicebuilding in this case. It seemed quite random.
I notice that the commercial version replaces the grid-based map with a graph -- probably it makes the game better, but also
means that the remaining similarity to roguelikes is lost.

I qualify it as roguelike, although it could be argued it is not (you cannot just press a key to

If you are wondering whether a roguelike really needs to be grid-based, this is a great

This is an {Angband} variant that feels more like its own game than
like an Angband variant, with many fans in the roguelike community.
It is shorter, and has its own mechanics such as songs. I have played
the tutorial -- I was quite annoyed by how it said that in every
roguelike you restart when you die (in most popular roguelikes this 
is the player's decision which IMO makes permadeath actually better
and I prefer it that way), it did still have a bit of Angband feel
(although hard to blame the game for that), and I was not that in
the mood for playing a complex game, so I have not tried to go further yet.

GAME Billiard Dungeon
VAL pc roguelike 7drl medieval year=2016 played=2016 turnbased rpgequip rpgstats rpgconsume topdown hscroll vscroll procgen exp combat midres seq=? xp=3 free randomized
An experimental borderline roguelike which is not grid-based -- as the
name suggests, you move like in billiards, by being a ball hit by a
stick, bouncing off walls and enemies. An interesting experiment.

GAME Untrusted
VAL pc roguelike engineering cyberspace year=2013 played=2013 turnbased grid topdown procgen diagrid exp combat ascii seq xp=3 free randomized
A free game with roguelike interface but that is more about Javascript
hacking, you get access to edit the source code of the game, and you
have to do things like change the dungeon generation to proceed in the
story. Free and quite interesting.

GAME The Life of a Government Clerk
VAL pc roguelike year=2025 played=2025 uniquetheme turnbased grid topdown procgen exp combat ascii tiny xp=2 orthogrid free randomized
A Kafkaesque non-combat roguelike. Quite hard to understand what is going on.

GAME Cogmind

This is one of the most popular roguelikes, although I have not tried
it myself. The focus on being a machine reminds me of {Dungeoneers}.

A roguelike in the style of {ADOM} but with an underwater theme.
Many enemies are based on actual aquatic creatures. Quite a fun
adventure.

GAME Haque
VAL pc roguelike year=2017 played=2020 pc xp=2 medieval turnbased grid rpgequip rpgconsume topdown procgen traps=? idminigame=? orthogrid=? exp combat lores seq randomized manualsave secrets=? traps=? blackboard
A roguelike with glitch aeshtetics. It seemed impossible to turn off animations, which made the game feel slow to me (a bad thing, especially in a roguelike).
Solid otherwise.
