Roguelike started in 1993 to mean the specific way of controlling the character in an
RPG game, invented in Rogue and cloned in other free games. This specific way of controlling
the character is indeed very special, and as such, it features in this database as the
{tag:roguelike} tag, actually a {group:timeflow} supergenre.

Nevertheless, this genre has evolved separately from the mainstream gaming, and as such,
it has evolved its own philosophy, or more precisely, multiple philosophies that are at
times conflicting. Some people refer to games partially sharing these philosophies as
"roguelike".

The most well-known philosophy is of course the idea of "procgen + permadeath": playing the
game repeatedly until you master them, and using randomization to make sure that playing
games that way is actually fun. This database does not feature permadeath as a tag, because
it is essentially meaningless as a method of categorizing games -- mostly anything can be
played permadeath or not, as a player's choice; and furthermore, this philosophy is more
generic to many {strategy} games, and even solitaires from XIXth century. (In early roguelike
definitions it was not mentioned or more of a quality measure.)
This philosophy has inspired the {roguelite philosophy}, although later, that philosophy
has diverged.

Nevertheless, I think a game such as {Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup} does turn permadeath into something
actually interesting (rather than just a "git gud" skill check) -- I mean, strategical resource
management: you get a limited amount of resources and you need to use them correctly to
minimize the probability of not surviving an encounter. Still, this is just a combination
of having such resources ({tag:rpgconsume}) and anti-grinding (no {tag:intrapower}), done extremely
well, rather than some new quality.

There is also the philosophy of open-source community development -- people making fun
games for themselves, and letting others to build on them -- that is otherwise
very rare in video games (although lots of great software has been created that way), 
and the {tag:simulationism} philosophy that lead to actually the biggest games such as
{Dwarf Fortress} and {Minecraft}. And of course {Diablo} and other ARPGs are very similar
to early roguelikes.

GAME roguelite philosophy
AKA roguelite
VAL philosophy pc notheme year=2008 ea=1986 xp=4 played=2008 gambletheme combat randomized unlocks itemlock metapower seq modalbattle deckbuilder enginebuilder rpgstats rpgclasses roguelite ddlike spireview trail

The roguelite philosophy started as a combination of the mastery {roguelike philosophy} and the
{arcade philosophy}: procedural generation of roguelikes, short runs of arcade games.
While early roguelites such as {Spelunky} were philosophically similar to hardcore roguelikes,
further on roguelites started encompassing more and more {dark} patterns: {tag:metapower}
and other forms of metaprogression, flashy gambling themes, gambling-style randomness, and so on.
Procedural generation was replaced with {tag:enginebuilder} mechanics, which feels a bit similar
in the way it makes every run different, but is technically a very different thing.

There are some games with metaprogression that I like; it could be used to provide a "character growth" arc.
Features such as {tag:unlocks} and {tag:itemlock} may be used to avoid overwhelming the player with
content they would not understand immediately. Unfortunately, it has the same problem as
forced permadeath: it forces players to replay a game, even if they no longer find it fun, to
see all the content; and since fun is subjective, it is generally impossible to design metaprogression
in a way satisfying to everyone. It is also commonly impossible (or virtually impossible) to win
without metaprogression, or, alternatively, even if you win, it won't unlock the content, you have to
win multiple times. Some players like metaprogression because it makes them feel
they achieved something -- although the opponents of metaprogression counter this by noticing that
the reward is not a real thing, only some in-game currency, and the game (or a cheat engine) could
as well have given the "reward" right away and that would make it more fun.

GAME metroidvania philosophy
AKA metroidvania
VAL philosophy console gothic year=2001 ea=1986 xp=4 notheme exp combat platformer fixed nonlinear return ability bossfights played=2007
BY Koji Igarashi

As far as I know, the term "metroidvania" has started as a way to refer to the part of
Castlevania series that is like {Metroid}, and later was adapted to refer to the whole genre.
(<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rec.games.video.nintendo/c/Iq7Q2fqdkIE/m/hOLAJKzHR8QJ">This</a> appeaars the first post
on Usenet using the word "metroidvania", the next one is from 2005!)
It is mostly used this way today, although I sometimes people who are more strict and say it
is only a "metroidvania" and it includes Castlevania elements, such as the greater focus on RPG stuff like actual items, too.
I consider my first interaction with modern metroidvania to be {Cave Story} and {La Mulana}, although I did not know then
that such games were called metroidvania, this term has exploded much later.

I feel the name is not really appropriate. You want a game to explore a world and a story. You make it a platformer
because platformers are cool. You make the character gain new abilities because bigger games get boring otherwise. 
You use these abilities as a way to gate content. This is all a very natural design philosophy that maybe should not
really be credited to those particular console games -- I have played lots of early 8bit computer games that follow
a similar philosophy. {Antiriad} has all of that, other games mostly miss the idea of "character growth", but then,
"character growth" was quite rare in games then. Is the {tag:ability} gating really that important for how these games
feel, or is it more about exploration?

Nevertheless, the term is very useful. Looking through the Steam achievement stags for metroidvania games, it is quite
sad that clearly most players do not progress very far in them. So they do not even experience the story and the
character growth which is supposed to define the genre...

I do not know what soulslike is supposed to mean. I have played games that are sometimes referred
to as soulslikes, but not the games these games were supposedly "like".
It seems to be a collection of mostly unrelated mechanics. Which are quite fun.

GAME immersive sim philosophy
VAL philosophy pc moderntheme notheme fpp exp stealth fixed camscroll rpgstats photorealistic models simulationism xp=1 ea=1990 year=2000 played=2025

Yet another puzzling philosophy. The definitions I read are about how you are supposed
to solve challenges the way you want, for example, you can fight the guard,
but you can also use traps, stealth, or bribe them. All that because of the game
simulating lots of things. When I read that, it looks very much like the {tag:simulationism}
part of the {roguelike philosophy}, and roguelikes do it better. Apparently "immersive"
is supposed to refer to the first-person perspective and photorealistic graphics,
contrary to the "use your own imagination" style of immersion used by roguelikes.
But apparently some people do not find this important.

GAME boomer shooter philosophy

BY John Romero

Some people like the design of classic {tag:fpp} {tag:shooter} games such as Doom
and not the design of more modern first-person shooters. I read a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/18jwesc/what_is_a_boomer_shooter/">definition</a> of
boomer shooter, it includes things like: fast movement,
more enemies, non-linear maps with {tag:secrets}, resource economy, fantasy themes,
variety of weapons and enemies. 
It had the vibes of Berlin Interpretation: a collection of not
strictly related properties and not mentioning the basic stuff like being
shooters or being first person. Might become a name of a new genre that
focuses on some of these properties without being shooters anymore.

GAME CRPG philosophy
AKA CRPG
VAL philosophy pc medieval exp fixed rpgequip rpgconsume rpgstats rpgquests rpgclasses xp=2 year=1980 played=1996

Taken literally, Computer Role-Playing Game and {adventure} should mean exactly the same thing
-- something like a book, but where you play the main character. The reason for "C" prefix
is not to gatekeep consoles and mobile devices, but to separate from pen-and-paper role-playing
games -- CRPGs want to emulate the experience, although that is not really possible in
a computer program. The first CRPGs I have played were {Valhalla} and {Son of the Empire},
I noticed the similarities (characters described by stats), but I did not know where
they come from.

Most CRPG definitions also include "character growth" as a core part of the definition.
It sounds quite funny today since most modern games have character growth of some kind,
it is probably harder to find a game that does not have character growth. (It was
definitely not so in the 80s, character growth was rare.)
In the past, I found it funny when {HyperRogue} was classified as a role-playing game
due to the (almost) lack of character growth, but I do not care anymore, it is still
an adventure.

At some point, I have filled a poll which included questions about kinds of games I like,
and since it did not include "{roguelike}", I had to choose between "{strategy}" and RPG.
I picked strategy, because I am typically annoyed playing non-roguelike RPGs -- the
gameplay is not that good, unless you play one of the RPG subgenres defined by their
good gameplay, such as {roguelike}. Nevertheless, RPG elements in all kinds of games are
great.

GAME strategy philosophy
AKA strategy
VAL nonvideo philosophy pc notheme history military topdown turnbased pauseable squad army xxxx cardgame economy randomized procgen grid deckbuilder deckconstruction year=-2400 xp=3 played=1986

Strategy video games, essentially, evolved from tabletop games.
Mostly {Chess}, and thus, you control an army, but I do not consider this
necessary for being a strategy game. They focus on making
decisions. As such, strategy games were originally turn-based.
Being video games, it is possible to make them more complex, using
mechanics that would be too cumbersome for pen-and-paper play. Although there
are still good reasons to keep things simple. Who likes +3% to all resistances?
(More of a {CRPG} example but you get the idea.)

We also no longer had to make them turn-based. But "real-time strategy" were
controversial -- are they really still strategy games?
It did not matter that much in the end, since RTS seem to be considered a separate
genre, and you can always say "turn-based strategy" if you need this aspect.
I like the decision-making aspect although I do not like micromanagement, so
{roguelike} and roguelike-like games are better than army or economy games.

GAME arcade philosophy
VAL philosophy arcade oldpc notheme fixed flick endless lores realtime seq xp=3 year=1980 played=1985
BY country: Japan

The arcade philosophy refers mostly to the fact that early video games tended to be
very hard -- whether they were actual arcade games, or games of similar style created
for computers and consoles.

Some people claim that the only reason they were hard so that people dropped more coins
in the arcade machines, and hard games do not make sense anymore -- but that is silly,
given that this was the case not only in arcade games, and also given the ongoing popularity
of various kinds of hard games, and of course there are lots of people who like hard games,
and probably the designers of those early games were simply among these people.
Also, I imagine them to consider that these kinds of games were a better application of the
new technologies than {adventure} (better read a book or watch a movie) or {strategy}
(better play tabletop games).

GAME dark philosophy
AKA dark
VAL philosophy android paytowin notheme timegate incremental metapower picklevel minigames endless hires multiplayer xp=1 year=2006 played=2017

The dark philosophy is named after the website "dark patterns" which informs potential
players about psychologically manipulative patterns found in video games. These games
generally attempt not to provide a meaningful experience to the player, but rather
manipulate them into spending time and money with the game. They are usually marketed
towards casual players ({tag:android} and {tag:web} users) using misleading ads.
They are marketed as free games, but eventually hope that the player will want to buy
something to skip the boring gameplay (I have never bought anything, but I assume that
the only result would be eventually persuading the player to buy even more to skip the
even more boring gameplay).

(Somehow the dark patterns website lists many dark patterns in {HyperRogue}... the reviewer
must have been very at interpreting even slight hints as darkness. Generally the
{roguelike philosophy} is about making fun games for themselves, which is the opposite
of darkness.)

GAME thinky philosophy
VAL nonvideo philosophy riddles cardgame wordgame matching logic timeless fixed grid shapegfx rulediscovery xp=2 year=1982 spacebending engineering played=1986
Games about solving problems. The name refers to the "thinky games" website and community,
which is in turn an offshoot of Alan Hazelden's thinky puzzle discord started in 2018.
This discord was somewhat difficult to find and yet apparently most of the names (big
or small) I know working on such games are there. I think this just means that these
people are good at solving puzzles.
The core is puzzle games (the handcrafted ones, 75% of which are {tag:grid}-based),
although, among others, {strategy}, {tag:rulediscovery}, {tag:spacebending}, and {tag:engineering}
games are welcome too.

I find many aspects of this philosophy/community similar to their {roguelike} counterparts.
In roguelikes you also solve problems. There are games regarded as gems in this community
which have not been very popular elsewhere. There is a feel of a community of authors and
players highlighting great experimental games (similar to roguelikes, but some other genre
communities feel very focused on self-promotion). Their ThinkyCons are inspired by similar
roguelike meetings.

There are some differences too. The "core" part, thinky puzzle games, are considered
elegant when have just one solution, and when the puzzle is small, containing just the
thing you need to solve the puzzle. The puzzle should be handcrafted, and probably
abstract.
Roguelikes (and related genres such as RPG and strategy) are
often the opposite in all these aspects, and I prefer the roguelike counterparts.
Somehow there are currently not that many roguelikes in the database, other than
more puzzly ones. (My favorite thinky puzzle game is the {DROD} series which, while
handcrafted, puts lost of focus on the exploration of large levels and worldbuilding.)

GAME adventure philosophy
AKA adventure
VAL philosophy itemuse timeless riddles fixed ascii xp=3 year=1975 played=1990

To me, an adventure game is simply a game that lets you take on a role of a character
in some world, as in, if you wrote down your adventures, it would make a (somewhat)
good book. It is a quite literal interpretation. Yes, this includes most games today,
and that is fine. It was not that common in the 80s.

In the past we had other views, for example, <i>The Book of Adventure Games</i> (Kim Shuette, 1984)
divides adventures into two categories, "puzzle adventures" (text adventures of the
time, and point-and-click adventures that evolved from them) and "fantasy adventures"
(essentially what we call {CRPG} today). The name of the "text adventure" genre
seems to come from {Colossal Cave Adventure}; it is good that they seem to be more
commonly called Interactive Fiction today.

GAME indie philosophy
AKA indie
VAL philosophy pc free=? lores xp=3 year=2010 ea=1990 played=?
Yet another puzzling philosophy. The name suggests independence from big publishers,
both financial and creative; the philosophy is about games created by small teams,
avoiding for-profit techniques such as lootboxes, creativity, experimental nature, and cheap graphical styles such as {tag:lores} pixel art.
There is also the related philosophy of "solodev" games, which, as the name suggests,
are games made by a single person. Both tags are used as keywords to find good games
that would be hard to find otherwise in the sea of AAA games.

From my point of view, of a person who has played roguelikes and other underdogs
since the 90s, there are a lot of problems with some indie narratives.

<b>Indie is yet another buzzword.</b>
I have seen a claim that "indie" might be better used to refer to the specific movement from
about 2010 when big companies such as Microsoft and Sony pushed for small developers to publish
games on their platforms, and marketing such games as "indie".
Sometimes big (or small) publishers market games as indie or solodev while not really
having the indie spirit or made by a solo dev. But, that seems to be just the top of the
iceberg. Having a publisher goes against the claimed spirit, in my opinion. Indie is used
as a buzzword. So-called "indie" games hijacking {roguelike} as a meaningless buzzword
is especially annoying.

<b>Historical narration.</b>
One popular narration associated with the above is that ~2010 was the beginning of "indie"
video games. Which is false. If we go with "games made for fun", we had {roguelike}s
in the 80s and 90s, and lots of other games. I was a big fan of the "Home of the Underdogs"
website that featured lots of underrated free games in early 00s. (It was more of a museum
of underrated video games, and also included abandonware titles.) There is a claim
that what started in ~2010 was that indies were becoming financially successful,
but that is weird too -- we had the {tag:shareware} movement in the 90s that produced lots
of famous games such as {Doom}, and it was also very much about distributing games
without having access to big channels, why is that ignored?

<b>Is financial success really the goal?</b> Indie developers such as {by:Notch} became
billionaires from making a game they wanted to make, and indie developers think
they can replicate this. But they fail. Commonly blaming the lack of marketing,
although in most cases the game is probably simply bad, and becoming a huge
success rather than a "hidden gem" is a matter of luck. Anyway, is it really
worth to spend ages polishing games, work on marketing, abuse buzzwords,
and be generally stressed, when nothing of this guarantees success anyway,
instead of having a stable non-game job and making games for fun?

<b>Avoiding darkness.</b> Indie is supposed to be about avoiding nasty stuff such
as {dark} patterns -- lootbox gambling, etc. -- but technically, studios making big
{dark} mobile games are independent too. More recently, many indie games marketing
themselves as roguelike (while not even being {roguelite} by philosophy) use
inspiration from gambling games to be more addictive without being actually
fulfilling -- even though you lose only your time, these things are quite dim.

<b>Experimental creativity.</b> Many people find the claim of experimental creativity
puzzling when they see the flood of so-called "indie" games that just follow
the latest design trends. I think the claim is partially true -- the label is a keyword
to find creative games, which does not mean that all games using that label are creative
(90% of indies are crap because 90% of everything is crap),
but that it helps people to find games that could be hard to find if the label did
not exist. Still, it is used as a buzzword to capitalize on these associations.
What about experimental games made by scientists though? If they are funded with grants,
they are probably not that independent.

<b>The myth of a solo dev.</b> While the romantic idea of a developer making a game
all by themselves is alluring, there is an issue that the secret to being a successful
solo developers is to hide the contributions from other people. One never works alone.
You need testers. If the game is to be popular, you need people to tell others about
the game (=marketers). You need other games to take inspiration from, and tools.
More focus should be on collaboration instead, like the {by:community} development
philosophy common in the best {roguelike}s. Why make music yourself when you could
hire a musician instead?

GAME Japanese RPG philosophy
AKA jRPG
VAL philosophy console medieval topdown modalbattle turnbased squad fixed rpgequip rpgconsume rpgstats rpgquests anime xp=1 year=1982 played=2000
BY country: Japan

I associate jRPGs mostly with their combat style: the party and the enemies are displayed
on the screen but the geometry does not matter; you can use menus to give commands
to your characters (attack, cast spell, etc.). This is a rather distinctive style
that I call "jRPG-style combat", and should probably have its own name, especially that
not all jRPGs use that (some are {tag:roguelike}s and some are tactical grid RPGs),
and a similar style has been used in many non-Japanese games ({Slay the Spire} and likes,
{Darkest Dungeon}, etc.). It is commonly called simply "turn-based RPG" but that is
very imprecise when there are so many other kinds of turn-based RPGs! I know there are
some more specific names, like ATB, but that seems to be something more specific.

Anyway, I am not a fan of jRPG-style combat. I have played {Chrono Trigger} since it
seemed to be the best jRPG and I did not like it, mostly because of the boring combat.
(I consider {Kyle's Quest} to be the first jRPG-ish game that I played.)
I think fans do not like the combat either, they play them for the story.
