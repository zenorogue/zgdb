Roguelike started in 1993 to mean the specific way of controlling the character in an
RPG game, invented in Rogue and cloned in other free games. This specific way of controlling
the character is indeed very special, and as such, it features in this database as the
{tag:roguelike} tag, actually a {group:timeflow} supergenre.

Nevertheless, this genre has evolved separately from the mainstream gaming, and as such,
it has evolved its own philosophy, or more precisely, multiple philosophies that are at
times conflicting. Some people refer to games partially sharing these philosophies as
"roguelike".

The most well-known philosophy is of course the idea of "procgen + permadeath": playing the
game repeatedly until you master them, and using randomization to make sure that playing
games that way is actually fun. This database does not feature permadeath as a tag, because
it is essentially meaningless as a method of categorizing games -- mostly anything can be
played permadeath or not, as a player's choice; and furthermore, this philosophy is more
generic to many {strategy} games, and even solitaires from XIXth century. (In early roguelike
definitions it was not mentioned or more of a quality measure.)
This philosophy
has inspired the {roguelite philosophy}.

There is also the philosophy of open-source community development -- people making fun
games for themselves, and letting others to build on them -- that is otherwise
very rare in video games (although lots of great software has been created that way), 
and the {tag:simulationism} philosophy that lead to actually the biggest games such as
{Dwarf Fortress} and {Minecraft}. And of course {Diablo} and other ARPGs are very similar
to early roguelikes.

The roguelite philosophy started as a combination of the mastery {roguelike philosophy} and the
{arcade philosophy}: procedural generation of roguelikes, short runs of arcade games.
While early roguelites such as {Spelunky} were philosophically similar to hardcore roguelikes,
further on roguelites started encompassing more and more {dark} patterns: {tag:metapower},
flashy gambling themes, gambling-style randomness, and so on. Procedural generation was replaced
with {tag:enginebuilder} mechanics, which feels a bit similar in the way it makes every run
different, but is technically a very different thing.

GAME metroidvania philosophy
AKA metroidvania
VAL philosophy console gothic year=? ea=1986 xp=4 notheme exp combat platformer fixed nonlinear return ability bossfights
BY Koji Igarashi

As far as I know, the term "metroidvania" has started as a way to refer to the part of
Castlevania series that is like {Metroid}, and later was adapted to refer to the whole genre.
It is mostly used this way today, although I sometimes people who are more strict and say it
is only a "metroidvania" and it includes Castlevania elements, such as the greater focus on RPG stuff like actual items, too.

I feel the name is not really appropriate. You want a game to explore a world and a story. You make it a platformer
because platformers are cool. You make the character gain new abilities because bigger games get boring otherwise. 
You use these abilities as a way to gate content. This is all a very natural design philosophy that maybe should not
really be credited to those particular console games -- I have played lots of early 8bit computer games that follow
a similar philosophy. {Antiriad} has all of that, other games mostly miss the idea of "character growth", but then,
"character growth" was quite rare in games then. Is the {tag:ability} gating really that important for how these games
feel, or is it more about exploration?

Nevertheless, the term is very useful.

I do not know what soulslike is supposed to mean. I have played games that are sometimes referred
to as soulslikes, but not the games these games were supposedly "like".
It seems to be a collection of mostly unrelated mechanics. Which are quite fun.

GAME immersive sim philosophy
VAL philosophy pc moderntheme notheme fpp exp stealth fixed camscroll rpgstats photorealistic models simulationism xp=1 ea=1990 year=2000

Yet another puzzling philosophy. The definitions I read are about how you are supposed
to solve challenges the way you want, for example, you can fight the guard,
but you can also use traps, stealth, or bribe them. All that because of the game
simulating lots of things. When I read that, it looks very much like the {tag:simulationism}
part of the {roguelike philosophy}, and roguelikes do it better. Apparently "immersive"
is supposed to refer to the first-person perspective and photorealistic graphics,
contrary to the "use your own imagination" style of immersion used by roguelikes.
But apparently some people do not find this important.

GAME boomer shooter philosophy

BY John Romero

Some people like the design of classic {tag:fpp} {tag:shooter} games such as Doom
and not the design of more modern first-person shooters. I read a definition of
boomer shooter, it had the vibes of Berlin Interpretation: a collection of not
strictly related properties and not mentioning the basic stuff like being
shooters or being first person. Might become a name of a new genre that
focuses on some of these properties without being shooters anymore.

Apparently map "secrets" are a part of this philososophy.

GAME dark philosophy
AKA dark

The dark philosophy is named after the website "dark patterns" which informs potential
players about psychologically manipulative patterns found in video games. These games
generally attempt not to provide a meaningful experience to the player, but rather
manipulate them into spending time and money with the game. They are usually marketed
towards casual players ({tag:android} and {tag:web} users) using misleading ads.
They are marketed as free games, but eventually hope that the player will want to buy
something to skip the boring gameplay (I have never bought anything, but I assume that
the only result would be eventually persuading the player to buy even more to skip the
even more boring gameplay).

(Somehow the dark patterns website lists many dark patterns in {HyperRogue}... the reviewer
must have been very at interpreting even slight hints as darkness. Generally the
{roguelike philosophy} is about making fun games for themselves, which is the opposite
of darkness.)

GAME thinky philosophy
VAL nonvideo philosophy riddles cardgame wordgame matching nonlogic logic timeless fixed grid shapegfx rulediscovery xp=2 year=1982 spacebending engineering
Games about solving problems. The name refers to the "thinky games" website and community,
which is in turn an offshoot of Alan Hazelden's thinky puzzle discord started in 2018.
This discord was somewhat difficult to find and yet apparently most of the names (big
or small) I know working on such games are there. I think this just means that these
people are good at solving puzzles.
The core is puzzle games (the handcrafted ones, 75% of which are {tag:grid}-based),
although, among others, {strategy}, {tag:rulediscovery}, {tag:spacebending}, and {tag:engineering}
games are welcome too.

I find many aspects of this philosophy/community similar to their {roguelike} counterparts.
In roguelikes you also solve problems. There are games regarded as gems in this community
which have not been very popular elsewhere. There is a feel of a community of authors and
players highlighting great experimental games (similar to roguelikes, but some other genre
communities feel very focused on self-promotion). Their ThinkyCons are inspired by similar
roguelike meetings.

There are some differences too. The "core" part, thinky puzzle games, are considered
elegant when have just one solution, and when the puzzle is small, containing just the
thing you need to solve the puzzle. The puzzle should be handcrafted, and probably
abstract.
Roguelikes (and related genres such as RPG and strategy) are
often the opposite in all these aspects, and I prefer the roguelike counterparts.
Somehow there are currently not that many roguelikes in the database, other than
more puzzly ones. (My favorite thinky puzzle game is the {DROD} series which, while
handcrafted, puts lost of focus on the exploration of large levels and worldbuilding.)

GAME indie philosophy
AKA indie
VAL philosophy pc free=? lores xp=3 year=2010 ea=1990
Yet another puzzling philosophy. The name suggests independence from big publishers,
both financial and creative; the philosophy is about games created by small teams,
avoiding for-profit techniques such as lootboxes, creativity, experimental nature, and cheap graphical styles such as {tag:lores} pixel art.
There is also the related philosophy of "solodev" games, which, as the name suggests,
are games made by a single person. Both tags are used as keywords to find good games
that would be hard to find otherwise in the sea of AAA games.

From my point of view, of a person who has played roguelikes and other underdogs
since the 90s, there are a lot of problems with some indie narratives.

<b>Indie is yet another buzzword.</b>
I have seen a claim that "indie" might be better used to refer to the specific movement from
about 2010 when big companies such as Microsoft and Sony pushed for small developers to publish
games on their platforms, and marketing such games as "indie".
Sometimes big (or small) publishers market games as indie or solodev while not really
having the indie spirit or made by a solo dev. But, that seems to be just the top of the
iceberg. Having a publisher goes against the claimed spirit, in my opinion. Indie is used
as a buzzword. So-called "indie" games hijacking {roguelike} as a meaningless buzzword
is especially annoying.

<b>Historical narration.</b>
One popular narration associated with the above is that ~2010 was the beginning of "indie"
video games. Which is false. If we go with "games made for fun", we had {roguelike}s
in the 80s and 90s, and lots of other games. I was a big fan of the "Home of the Underdogs"
website that featured lots of underrated free games in early 00s. (It was more of a museum
of underrated video games, and also included abandonware titles.) There is a claim
that what started in ~2010 was that indies were becoming financially successful,
but that is weird too -- we had the {tag:shareware} movement in the 90s that produced lots
of famous games such as {Doom}, and it was also very much about distributing games
without having access to big channels, why is that ignored?

<b>Is financial success really the goal?</b> Indie developers such as {by:Notch} became
billionaires from making a game they wanted to make, and indie developers think
they can replicate this. But they fail. Commonly blaming the lack of marketing,
although in most cases the game is probably simply bad, and becoming a huge
success rather than a "hidden gem" is a matter of luck. Anyway, is it really
worth to spend ages polishing games, work on marketing, abuse buzzwords,
and be generally stressed, when nothing of this guarantees success anyway,
instead of having a stable non-game job and making games for fun?

<b>Avoiding darkness.</b> Indie is supposed to be about avoiding nasty stuff such
as {dark} patterns -- lootbox gambling, etc. -- but technically, studios making big
{dark} mobile games are independent too. More recently, many indie games marketing
themselves as roguelike (while not even being {roguelite} by philosophy) use
inspiration from gambling games to be more addictive without being actually
fulfilling -- even though you lose only your time, these things are quite dim.

<b>Experimental creativity.</b> Many people find the claim of experimental creativity
puzzling when they see the flood of so-called "indie" games that just follow
the latest design trends. I think the claim is partially true -- the label is a keyword
to find creative games, which does not mean that all games using that label are creative
(90% of indies are crap because 90% of everything is crap),
but that it helps people to find games that could be hard to find if the label did
not exist. Still, it is used as a buzzword to capitalize on these associations.
What about experimental games made by scientists though? If they are funded with grants,
they are probably not that independent.

<b>The myth of a solo dev.</b> While the romantic idea of a developer making a game
all by themselves is alluring, there is an issue that the secret to being a successful
solo developers is to hide the contributions from other people. One never works alone.
You need testers. If the game is to be popular, you need people to tell others about
the game (=marketers). You need other games to take inspiration from, and tools.
More focus should be on collaboration instead, like the {by:community} development
philosophy common in the best {roguelike}s. Why make music yourself when you could
hire a musician instead?
