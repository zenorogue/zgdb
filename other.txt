## arcade classics, listed for reference

GAME Pac-Man
AKA Pacman
BY Namco
BY country: Japan
VAL year=1980 arcade realtime topdown spacebending abstract xp=0 collectathon fixed tiny lores endless
I think I have played the arcade version somewhere, but I mostly played {Munch-It} (Amstrad CPC clone) and {CD-Man} (PC clone).

GAME Missile Command
BY Atari Games
VAL year=1980 played=2001 arcade realtime sideview shooter palmos scifi xp=2 randomized endless vectorart blackboard
Yet another arcade classic, although probably less known than e.g. {Asteroids}. Enemy missiles approach your cities,
you need to fight them with missiles of your own; enemy missiles exploding in the air may destroy other enemy missiles if
they are closed enough. I mostly played a PalmOS version that I do not remember the name of.

GAME Asteroids
BY Atari Games
VAL year=1979 played=2000 arcade realtime topdown shooter spacebending palmos scifi xp=2 randomized seq endless vectorart mono blackboard
Everyone should know this famous spacebending arcade game.
I do not think I have played the original arcade version. I mostly played a PalmOS version that I do not remember the name of.

GAME Space Invaders
BY Taito
BY country: Japan
VAL year=1978 played=1987 sideview realtime shooter arcade cpc xp=2 scifi lores fixed seq endless mono blackboard

A famous game where you have to kill all alien invaders; the invader sprite is sometimes used as a gaming symbol.
The aliens move all together as a group, far left to far right, descend, far right to far left, descend, and so on,
until they captured you. One interesting thing was that how fast the invaders descended dependent on how much you have killed. Killing leftmost, rightmost, or bottommost
invaders was a good idea, and they moved very fast if there were just a few of them -- apparently this was not intended but it was quite unique and fun.

GAME Tetris
BY Alexey Pajitnov
BY country: Russia
VAL year=1988 played=1992 cpc pc realtime sideview grid xp=3 abstract endless orthogrid randomized tiny difflevels shapegfx shapepuzzle
One of the most famous games from the 80s, and deservedly so. I have first played a CPC version that was not official, I think.
I have also played a classic PC version.

GAME Defender
VAL shooter sideview realtime hscroll year=1981 played=1990 gem=1 scifi xp=2 arcade pc gem=1 randomized lores endless
A quite interesting arcade game. You pilot a spaceship that could fly very fast if you wanted.
There was a planet with some people on, you fly around that planet, on low altitude, so the planet looks flat.
Aliens abducted these people, you could shoot aliens causing people to fall, you could catch them
and deliver back to the planet safely. I remember playing (or watching?) the CPC clone called {Defend or Die}, but more a PC clone.

GAME Donkey Kong
BY Nintendo
BY Shigeru Miyamoto
BY country: Japan
VAL arcade year=1981 xp=0 sideview realtime platformer notheme fixed seq lores endless
Famous for being one of the first games in the platformer genre, and also introducing the Mario character.
I have not played the original, but I have played a CPC clone called {Killer Gorilla}.

GAME Breakout
BY Atari Games
VAL arcade year=1976 xp=0 physics realtime abstract fpp tiny randomized shapegfx shooter difflevels endless
A well-known arcade game about destroying a wall of bricks with a ball. I have not played it, but I have played {Arkanoid} which was a cooler clone of it,
and some other clones (mostly of Arkanoid).

GAME Qix
BY Taito
BY country: Japan
VAL arcade year=1981 topdown realtime xp=0 abstract topdown realtime abstract pixelsim randomized seq endless shapegfx dodger
The game that {Zolyx} and {Xonix} were clones of. (Although I see it had "slow draw" for double points, while Zolyx and Xonix did not, I think.)
Very fun due to its unique rules.

GAME Pong
BY Atari Games
VAL arcade year=1972 xp=0 abstract realtime xp=0 topdown realtime physics shapegfx sports fixed tiny mono
Usually considered the first commercial video game. It was actually a piece of hardware, not software.
I have played the 'Paddle War' clone in {Commander Keen IV}, I guess it is a clone, and various {Arkanoid} clones which are somewhat similar?

GAME Centipede
BY Atari Games
VAL arcade year=1981 topdown realtime animaltheme shooter pc lores randomized tiny xp=0

I have not played this arcade classic, but I have played its clone {Killapede} on CPC, and a PC version that was free on Epic at some point.

## Atari ST

GAME Yie Are Kung Fu
BY Konami
BY country: Japan
VAL year=1985 played=1986 cpc xp=1 realtime slasher eastern atarist sideview fixed seq=? lores
A fighting game, I do not remember much.

GAME Night Hunter
VAL atarist gothic year=1988 played=1993 realtime slasher platformer fixed flick lores xp=1 sideview
Some kind of metroidvania-ish game about a guy who could transform into a monkey (?) or a bat.

# console classics
GAME Robots
AKA Chase
VAL year=1976 xp=3
A very simple but fun roguelike (at least according to the definition here...), you move on a grid, there are some robots who try to capture you,
but sometimes fall into each other. I think I have played not the original text console version, but a PalmOS version, not sure how it was named.

GAME Battlestar
VAL pc year=1979 played=2001 scifi riddles xp=2 nonspatial ascii timeless fixed connections free mono itemuse
One of games included in the BSD games. A rather strange interactive fiction game with many sections (first on a spaceship, then on an island of some kind).

GAME Colossal Cave Adventure
VAL pc year=1976 played=2001 medieval riddles xp=3 nonspatial ascii timeless fixed connections free mono itemuse
A classic dungeon crawler text adventure, not only the {adventure} genre was named after it, but it was also an inspiration of {Rogue}, I believe?
Lots of famous gaming quotes come from Colossal Cave Adventure. Do not miss out, definitely worth playing.

GAME Moon Buggy
VAL pc year=2004 played=2004 endless platformer scifi xp=2 sideview ascii realtime randomized
A very simple ASCII game where you drive a moon car, jumping over obstacles. Very similar to {Dinosaur game}.
I thought it was older. Not surprisingly, it seems to be a clone of an arcade game (Moon Patrol).

GAME Dinosaur game
VAL pc year=2014 played=2015 endless platformer scifi xp=2 sideview realtime randomized lores free mono
A simple game built into the Google Chrome browser, where you are a dinosaur and you have to jump over obstacles. Similar to {Moon Buggy}.

GAME Hunt the Wumpus
VAL pc year=1973 played=2007 xp=1 medieval medieval xp=1 nonspatial ascii connections timeless randomized exp combat free mono
One of BSD game classics. Somewhere between an adventure and strategy game, you move between 20 caves (interestingly, vertices of a dodecahedron)
and try to find out where the Wumpus, bats, and pits are. I have never tried to play it more seriously.

GAME Bastard Tetris
AKA Bastet
VAL pc year=2005 played=2007 abstract turnbased sideview grid xp=3 abstract endless orthogrid randomized tiny difflevels ascii shapepuzzle free
A {Tetris} clone except that the pieces are not determined randomly, but it always picks the worst possible piece for the player.
Interesting. It is very hard to actually get any lines here.

GAME Thrust
VAL pc year=? played=2002 scifi physics xp=3 sideview platformer realtime fixed seq vectorart free blackboard
One of games included with some Linux distro. I think it was a clone of earlier games. You had to lead some kind of a lander to a destination, with limited fuel.

# other

GAME Chess
BY country: Spain
BY country: India
VAL nonvideo year=1475 played=1986 xp=3 abstract turnbased army fixed multiplayer tiny grid orthogrid diagrid gem=1
I think Chess should be more talked about in video game circles. Sites such as chess.com have lots of members (100M). I meet lots of people in real life who
are playing Chess on their mobile phones or computers. So it can be considered a video game. (Thus a gem score.)

Sometimes people want to play Chess with me, assuming that I am very good at it -- which I am not (probably because I almost never play Chess). I find it quite funny.

(The queen has received its modern movement style around 1475 in Spain, so I give this as the year.)

GAME Go
AKA Igo
AKA Baduk
VAL year=-548 played=1993 gem=1 xp=2
BY country:Japan
An ancient boardgame. Probably not as popular outside of Japan as it should. It has a great handicap system to make players of different skill levels enjoy the game. Although
it appears that expert Go players playing against noobs love to win by 5 points instead of crushing them.

I have played some computer version in the 90s, and also an online implementation in 2015. I was fascinated by the fact that human players were significantly better than AI,
and in 2015 I started playing it more seriously -- however, soon after that, new AIs actually started winning, and I got interested in other things, so
I . Also, playing Go was quite tiring to me.

I like Go proverbs such as "lose your first 100 games as soon as possible" (you won't be winning right away and you should focus your early on experimenting rather than winning).

GAME Dots
AKA Kropki
BY Russia
VAL year=1980? played=1995
A game with some similarity to {Go} -- two players place dots on a piece of grid paper, you surround enemy dots with your dots. Contrary to Go,
it is enough to surround the enemy dots (they cannot survive even if they have liberties), and the surrounding dots forms a permanent group
that can be only captured as a whole. It was popular in Polish schools, although it seems to come from Russia.

GAME Gomoku
VAL year=1700 free
BY country: Japan
A game played on the {Go} board (15x15, 19x19 or infinite), but more similar to {Tic Tac Toe}, to win, you have to put 5 of your stones adjacent in a row.
I have mostly played the pen-and-paper version, quite a good game for boring classes in school.

GAME Tic Tac Toe
VAL nonvideo year=-1200 free
AKA Noughts and Crosses
BY country: Egypt
Not much to say about it, you probably know it, and should play {Gomoku} instead.

GAME Poker
AKA poker
VAL nonvideo year=1800 played=1998 abstract cardgame multiplayer randomized turnbased xp=2 seq free matching
A well-known card game about randomness and high-stakes permanent consequences. I remember when my friends convinced me to play Poker for money with theme,
and I won, but the game was quite messy and they did not want to calculate how much I won. So apparently Poker does not have permanent consequences, compared to a game like {Balatro}.

GAME Reversi
AKA Othello
VAL nonvideo year=1883 played=1992 pc
A well known game on a chessboard.
Somewhat strangely, the shareware program I played against was deterministic, and there was a sequence of a few moves that you could use to win early, by capturing all the enemies.

GAME Mahjong Solitaire
VAL matching year=1981
This solitaire using the {Mahjong} tiles appeared quite popular in 90s shareware games. Not much to say about it. I thought it was some classic Chinese solitaire, but according to
Wikipedia it was invented as a computer game.

GAME Mahjong
BY country: China
VAL year=1870

GAME Risk
VAL nonvideo year=1957 xp=0 abstract army multiplayer randomized turnbased tiny
I do not think I have ever played this classic boardgame, but I have played computer versions such as {Atlantis}.

GAME Hive
VAL nonvideo year=2001 played=2010 animaltheme xp=1 army grid hexgrid turnbased turnbased fixed=? tiny multiplayer
I have played this once.

GAME Magic: the Gathering
VAL nonvideo year=1993 xp=2 played=1999 cardgame ext medieval deckconstruction turnbased randomized paytowin tiny multiplayer
BY Richard Garfield

This is of course originally a physical card game, but I believe lots of people are playing online versions too.

There are lots of great things about this hugely influential game. I love how every card can change the rules in rather arbitrary ways (the first game I know
to do this). A bit like how items in roguelikes (and other RPGs) change rules (I do not mean anything special, but things like Rings of Strength changing the
wearer's strength). I consider MtG to be the inspiration for the system of item effects used in {Vapors of Insanity}. Richard Garfield appears to be a
roguelike fan (in fact, he appears to be a fan of my games, which I am very happy about), I imagine he could have even been one when MtG was originally created,
so I wonder whether there was some inspiration.

I sometimes play the Pentagram format with my friends, and I also participated in a sealed deck tournament once (I did not like the experience though).
However, I do not like the pay-to-win nature of the game. {Dominion} shares lots of great things without that pay-to-win aspect.
The pay-to-win nature means it makes lots of money, which means it gets lots of advertising to make even more money, which means that it is overrepresented
in the culture, relative to less pay-to-win designs such as Dominion (which of course has been heavily influenced by Magic: the Gathering).

GAME Dominion
VAL nonvideo year=2008 played=2011 xp=4 deckbuilder ext gem=3 medieval turnbased procgen randomized tiny cardgame multiplayer
BY Donald X Vaccarino

This is a physical card game, but when playing with many expansions, the rules are pretty complex, so it might be actually more feasible to play online.
There are currently two online versions, one is on Steam, one is on dominion.games. Both have different monetization schemes, and both allow playing the
base game for free. In the Steam version you need to "buy" cards to play with expansions (which is IIRC extremely expensive, and why should I buy the
virtual versions when I own physical cards), while dominion.games is subscription based -- only one of the players needs to "own" the cards, so you can
play everything for free, you just have to wait longer to match with an opponent who has cards. Not sure how practical this monetization scheme is --
it seems buying the subscription would put me at a higher risk of playing against trolls.

I like lots about Dominion design that is not apparent in other boardgames. In every run, 10 cards are chosen, and the players buy from stacks of 10 of each of
these 10 cards. This causes the game to be different every time, while also letting the players plan their strategy in advance. Roguelikes should learn from
this. (Deckbuilders such as {Slay the Spire} should learn from this, too.) Also there are attacks, but they do not attack a specific opponent, but all other
players -- this avoids the typical boardgame problem where it is pointless to play too well as then the opponents would notice and attack you instead of
each other. (Although Dominion is still better with less players because it is faster.)

GAME Scrabble
VAL nonvideo year=1948 abstract played=1993 xp=3 turnbased wordgame cardgame grid orthogrid randomized tiny multiplayer
A famous word game where you create a crossword. I remember playing Scrabble on a language camp, where the group was split into some teams, but my team
was led by some guys who ignored my suggestions and I got annoyed and joined some other team (and won I think)... Anyway, I do not see it being popular
anymore. Many video games claim to be similar to it, which can be true or not.

GAME Contract Bridge
AKA Bridge
VAL nonvideo year=1886 played=1995 abstract xp=2 turnbased cardgame randomized seq free multiplayer

This is not played much as a video game (although I remember some version on Amstrad CPC), but I think I have enough to talk about to include it in this site.

Bridge was quite big in my circles, with my school having lots of Bridge events that helped us to form lasting friendships. It was also very popular among
older players (such as my parents), and in my other circles. I feel it is not as popular anymore, having been displaced by the modern boardgames. I do not
find much information randomly about Bridge tournaments, for example.

The most interesting part of Bridge is the bidding phase, where you need to tell your partner about how strong your hand is to estimate how powerful your
combined hands are, using short messages consisting of a very limited set of symbols. So you should design a language to convey information efficiently.
That is quite unique and fascinating, maybe some amazing video game could be built around this. But the problem is, you do not actually design a language
yourself -- the common way to learn Bridge was to read books which describe some 'common language', and you use simply use that, unless you are so good
that you are able to invent a language that would be able to compete with it. Learning existing strategies was not as fascinating to me as what I love
about games, that is, inventing ones on my own. (That amazing video game could avoid that problem.)

GAME Uno
VAL nonvideo year=? xp=0 played=1988 turnbased cardgame randomized abstract tiny free multiplayer
A simple card game, play {Warthog} instead. Uno refers to a commercial version, but I guess the same idea, played with a standard deck of cards
(which was what I was playing), was played much earlier.

GAME Warthog
AKA Bartok
VAL nonvideo year=? played=1996 xp=2 turnbased cardgame randomized seq engineering abstract endless free multiplayer gem=3
One of my favorite card games. It is based on a simple card game {Uno}, but the winner of every run creates a new rule that will be used in the following
game. If you play it with right people, it can become very interesting due to all the chaos that the added rules introduce. The same approach can
be also applied to many other games!

GAME Mao
VAL nonvideo year=? played=2004 xp=1 turnbased cardgame randomized tiny rulediscovery abstract free multiplayer
A game like {Warthog}, but while in Warthog the rules are written down and clear to everyone, in Mao they are typically kept between the games, and also
known only to the author of the rule (the other players have to guess them by experimentation if they don't want to get penalty cards for breaking rules).
I think Warthog is more logical and fun -- the rules can be more complex and chaotic.

GAME Plants vs Zombies
VAL android gothic planttheme year=2009 played=2015 realtime defense economy fixed seq topdown xp=3 lores
I have played this famous game on a flight, it was installed on the on-flight entertainment system. Luckily it was exactly as long as the flight was;
it would be quite annoying to almost reach the end and then have to stop playing.

GAME Atic Atac
BY Ultimate Play the Game
VAL pc arcade medieval year=1983 played=2015 xp=1 topdown flick collectathon exp combat realtime randomized=? lores nonlinear
This was originally a game on ZX Spectrum; I have seen a claim of it being similar to {The Binding of Isaac}. It indeed has similar {Zelda}-style rooms, and some randomization, I think.

GAME Angry Birds
BY Rovio
BY country: Finland
VAL android year=2009 played=2012 xp=1 sideview physics turnbased vectorart animaltheme fixed seq hscroll ammolimit picklevel
Once a huge hit, but somehow it appears to be mostly forgotten... Of course I have played it too, but never very seriously.
It was mostly a clone of {Crush the Castle}.

GAME Crush the Castle
VAL web year=2009 played=2010 xp=1 sideview platformer physics turnbased photorealistic medieval fixed hscroll
A flash game that {Angry Birds} was a clone of. I remember playing it. The idea of crushing castles was fun, although it got boring quickly.

GAME 2048
BY country: Italy
VAL web grid orthogrid randomized turnbased abstract year=2014 played=2014 xp=2 topdown tiny ascii matching free
Once a very popular free web game, with many clones replacing the original "powers of two" tiles with something else, and also games mixing 2048 with {Tetris}
(you drop balls and two similar balls can combine into a larger ball). I have played it a bit, but mostly randomly, not trying to find a strategy to win. See also {Threes}.

GAME Merlin's Revenge
VAL web year=2004 played=2004 realtime rpgstats topdown exp combat fixed flick xp=3 medieval lores free nonlinear=?
A game that was somehow described as an "arcade roguelike" in the Polish roguelike usenet, probably as a joke. I do not remember much about it.

GAME Threes
VAL android year=2014 played=2014 xp=1 abstract turnbased matching topdown randomized tiny ascii
A mobile game that was an inspiration for much more popular (and somewhat simpler) {2048}. The developers did not seem happy about being ripped off. It did not feel that great to me,
but then, 2048 is not that great either.

GAME Bad Piggies
BY Rovio
BY country: Finland
VAL web year=2012 played=2013 xp=1 sideview physics turnbased vectorart animaltheme fixed seq hscroll
A game where you play as the antagonists from {Angry Birds}. The pigs do not use a slingshot but construct vehicles that ride into something to destroy it. Just like Angry Birds,
stops being interesting quickly.

GAME Dungeon Keeper
# BY Bullfrog Productions
BY Peter Molyneux
VAL pc year=1997 played=2007 xp=3 otherlinear medieval realtime exp combat army fixed seq lores destructible
A well-known game where you dig out a dungeon, train monsters, and use them to do something bad (kill heroes, or something?). Quite fun.
I think I played without sound which was somehow supposed to make the game better.

GAME Hero Wars
VAL android web paytowin year=2016 played=2017 xp=2 sideview medieval fixed metapower paytowin seq economy semiturnbased lores timegate
This is one of these games that does lots of marketing using fake gameplay videos. The game is filled with dark patterns and extremely boring grinding (or paying real money to prevent that).
A bit addictive, in the negative meaning (that is, addictive but hollow). I just wanted to experience a bad game.

GAME Forge of Empires
VAL web year=2012 paytowin xp=2 played=2019 isometric history fixed seq grid orthogrid timegate economy army hscroll vscroll minigames modalbattle models
Another game that did lots of fake marketing. According to Wikipedia it got some "best strategy" and "best browser" game awards, which shows that these awards must be very bad -- it is
clearly not a good game or a strategy game: maybe your strategy does matter a bit, but what matters more is entering the website at the correct times, or possibly paying money to prevent
the grind. I did advance my civilization quite far, but it was all very hollow.

GAME Backpack Hero
VAL pc year=2023 xp=1 played=2023 topdown spireview procgen randomized turnbased grid orthogrid enginebuilder animaltheme medieval lores roguelite exp combat seq=? trail modalbattle epicfree
I have played the demo. Maybe a good game but not good enough to counter the bad taste left by the misleading classification. 
It is a tableau builder, not a deckbuilder. And not a roguelike, of course, although its map layout feels a bit more roguelike than a typical spirelike.
It made me realize that {Hydra Slayer} could be marketed as a "roguelike deckbuilder" (the focus on inventory and synergies between their contents that is similar in both games).

GAME Final Fantasy
BY Square
BY country: Japan
VAL console year=1992 played=2025 xp=1 topdown modalbattle fixed rpgclasses rpgstats rpgequip=? rpgconsume=? medieval anime turnbased exp combat nonlinear=?
Why are the names of the games in this series so similar to each other (just numbered 1 to 16), should not the first one be "final"? I have tried one recently, but not very seriously,
and I do not remember which one it was (I think it was Final Fantasy V).

GAME Rogue Light
BY Managore
BY country: Australia
VAL pc roguelite xp=4 year=2014 played=2016 sideview platformer metapower realtime medieval hscroll vscroll procgen randomized lores free exp ammolimit gem=1
Just like the name suggests, Rogue Light is a good, free, metaprogression-focused platformer, where you are an archer explore a dark place, your primary light source being flaming arrows.
It is obviously impossible to win the game with the initial power, but you earn money that lets you make your arrows stronger and more plentiful.
There is metaprogression but no intraprogression, which is better than having both at once.

GAME Factorio
BY country: Czech
VAL pc xp=0 engineering pauseable=? hscroll vscroll grid orthogrid year=2016 scifi aliens topdown fixed=? lores manualsave=? crafting=? nonlinear=?
I have not played Factorio, but I have played some games inspired by it, such as {Mindustry} and {Shapez}.

GAME Stray
VAL pc animaltheme=2 scifi xp=0 exp camscroll tpp year=2022 realtime fixed photorealistic models
I found an opinion somewhere that there is not much actual gameplay and one may as well watch this game on YouTube, so this was exactly what we did.
Nice to see a game attempting to portrait a somewhat realistic cat character, although while the game was praised for realistic cat movement, the movement did not appear that realistic.

GAME Magic Survival
VAL android xp=2 year=? played=2024 bulletheaven notheme topdown realtime metapower seq vscroll hscroll uniquegfx
A very popular mobile game that inspired {Vampire Survivors}, and indeed, there is LOTS of similarity, with some VS spells being clear direct rip-offs.
I have played it after VS. It is quite fun, although it has many of the typical annoyances
of mobile game design (which Vampire Survivors did not copy and implemented a more PC-ish design instead). 
The game itself is technically free but it has metaprogression and thus requires either boring grinding or paying real money; also 
ads are displayed on death if you want to revive (I mostly play it on flights so the ads are not displayed and I simply revive). 
It looks quite weird on the screenshots. What actually seems to be going on is that the gameplay area  is logically a square, but it it vertically stretched to match the size of a mobile screen.
The mechanics are not clear, I have no idea what "ATK amplification" is supposed to mean.

GAME Colonization
BY Sid Meier
BY MicroProse
VAL pc year=1994 played=1996 xp=3 history topdown turnbased exp combat xxxx procgen randomized grid diagrid economy vscroll hscroll lores nonlinear
A sequel to {Civilization} of sorts. The gameplay is quite similar to Civilization, but you are only tasked with conquering the New World, originally as England, Spain, France
or the Netherlands; the Old World exists only as a place you trade with. The game has a very strong American focus -- the goal is to become an independent nation
(why not try being friendly with the old world instead?), instead of scientists, you have statesmen who provide bonuses by making the colonies politically stronger,
and there are weird special units that can be used for your independence war.
While in Civilization each "townsperson" was the same, in Colonization they all can leave their colonies (to travel to another
colony, possibly using weapons or horses), and they all have specializations (soldiers, scouts, farming, industry...). In the game data I have found a "teacher" specialization
that was not available in the actual game, which I found quite funny -- schools can be used to share a specialization with younger people, but obviously you want to teach them
something useful, not "teaching". Quite a complex game, with many kinds of resources (rather than just three available in Civ), probably too complex to me.

GAME Quadropus Rampage
VAL pc year=2013 7drl aquatic played=2013 xp=1 topdown realtime exp combat slasher procgen randomized seq vectorart endless free
A rather professional-looking game submitted to an early 7DRL competition, a kind of "action roguelike" with an aquatic theme, and not much complexity if I recall correctly.
I see that its mobile version seems to have 1M+ downloads and over 60K reviews, but it does not seem to be talked about anywhere. I guess it is more complex than the 7DRL
version, but I have not played it.
TAGCMT free
The 7DRL version was free, not sure how free the mobile one is, but it says "ridiculous amount of free content".

GAME Princess Maker

I have no idea what it is, but it has inspired {PrincessRL}.

GAME Wordle
VAL web year=2021 abstract wordgame played=2021 xp=3 timegate turnbased wordgame topdown randomized seq endless ascii free
This is a well-known and influential web word game, with cool one-per-day design, and a cool system of sharing your story for the given day online, without giving the
answer again. We have been playing Wordle daily for quite a long time, not only the original, but also the versions in various languages, whether we
know these languages or not (consistent with the somewhat well-known phenomenon of {Scrabble} tournaments being won by people who do not actually speak the given language
and just have learned the dictionary well).

GAME Crawl
VAL pc year=2017 played=2019 xp=1 lores medieval topdown realtime multiplayer exp combat roguelite rpgclasses rpgstats rpgequip procgen randomized modalbattle seq traps
A party game taking some inspiration from roguelike dungeon crawlers. One player takes the role of a "hero", and the others play as monsters trying to stop the hero's progress.
The name Crawl was originally somewhat annoying to me because one of the most popular and best roguelikes was commonly referred to as Crawl then, but somehow the problem has solved itself
and that other game is now referred to as {LDC} or {DCSS}. 

# recent games

GAME Tunic
VAL pc year=2022 played=2025 xp=2 animaltheme isometric connections hscroll vscroll ability return nonlinear ghosts realtime exp combat models megaitch bossfights rulediscovery secrets riddles
This is considered one of leading examples of the "metroidbrainia" genre. After playing it, I still do not feel that I understand the idea of this "genre". You still collect upgrades like in a
typical metroidvania. You collect manual pages during the game, and these manual pages are filled with puzzles, and occassionally explain some combination of keys that is crucial to the
progression. So, similar to {Animal Well}, to me, it is just a metroidvania with some secrets and riddles, rather than some new quality.

It seems we did a sequence break when playing Tunic -- there were some bushes that one is supposed to remove with a sword; however, the swords used by the enemies work too! So we led
the enemies to the bushes, gain access to rather hard areas; not having the sword, we played these areas like a stealth game, which was quite annoying. Then we actually did find the
sword and the rest of the game was more fun.

GAME Touhou Crawl
VAL pc year=2025 played=2025 xp=1 turnbased grid rpgequip rpgstats rpgconsume topdown hscroll vscroll nonlinear procgen return rpgclasses destructible traps idminigame diagrid roguelike anime uniquetheme free randomized manualsave exp combat
This is very similar to {Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup}.
It feels like a total conversion, although as far as I understand it is not one (i.e., it is independently programmed). The base design is very similar (the layout of the dungeon, race/class selection, god altars, skills, autoexplore) but the gods, items, monsters, spells are mostly all replaced with Touhou. (I see some DCSS spells such as Mephitic Cloud.)

I think it is more cool if you know the Touhou universe (my only experience so far with Touhou is watching Bad Apple many times, and Touhou Crawl does not seem to explain this universe), but it is still very cool!

VAL pc year=2013 played=2025 xp=2 rpgequip rpgstats rpgconsume arbi3 hscroll vscroll nonlinear procgen return rpgclasses rpgquests free nopersist medieval realtime exp combat minigames models photorealistic ext randomized bossfights traps multiplayer engineering
I have tried this to see how much of the {roguelike philosophy} remains in this game. And I think that, from games extremely popular today,
Path of Exile is one of the those in which this philosophy is the most clearly visible. The non-persistent map instances still remind me of {Angband}.

I like how everything is aligned to the three core attributes (Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence). Each core attribute is aligned to one way of avoiding damage.
"Gem skills" are also aligned to attributes, so what skills you can use also depends on your build. Each item is aligned to one or two (or three?) attributes, so
whether you focus on a single attribute or on many, you will find items that match your build.

There is a system of skill gem sockets -- your skills are represented as gems that you socket in your equipment. Sockets in a given piece of equipment can be linked;
in a single group of linked sockets you can put both "main" and "support" gems, and as a result, the spells (etc.) given by the "main" gems will be affected by the
modifiers coming from the "support" gems. The main/support system is cool enough to give this game the {tag:engineering} tag due to programmable magic, although
I do not like how it is linked to items -- if I could just replace my equipment when it has better stats, without taking into account that that new equipment has
worse sockets, I would be more happy to change my equipment commonly.

After Act I, the game seemed very boring; I decided to check what people online think, and they say that the campaign gets better, and anyway the campaign is just
a huge, mandatory tutorial for the actual game that follows after the campaign is completed. I have played the campaign till the end, and it indeed got better, although
I did not like the amount of weird minigames that got introduced on the way. In the end, monsters were likely to one-shot me, which was annoying -- from what I read,
I should have had 3000 energy shield by then, but I had only about 1000; probably I underinvested in defense. I read that some players play permadeath -- cool for them,
although I commonly died because of bad connection. (This is basically the only game in this database of this kind -- online only -- and I am not a fan of that:
I do not care about playing with random people, and otherwise, it mostly introduces problems.)

(I was also drawn due to comparisons to {Path of Achra} and {Tales of Maj'Eyal}. I think they said Path of Achra to be like Path of Exile but without such a long period
of building and thus more fun. Yeah, I agree with that, altohough I prefer roguelikes less focused on builds.)

GAME The Incredible Machine
VAL pc year=1993 played=1995 physics realtime autobattle sideview xp=4 gem=2 lores fixed seq engineering weirdtheme picklevel
A game about building a machine from available ingredients that will achieve some effect. Some of the available elements are common
(balloons, balls, slopes, etc.), while some are rather strange (various animals, such as cats which move when they see a mouse).
It seemed very popular in my circles at the time, and it had some sequels which I have not played, but somehow I do not see neither
TIM nor newer games of its kind discussed anymore.

GAME E-Motion
VAL pc year=1990 played=1993 realtime topdown matching xp=4 gem=1 shapegfx abstract fixed seq
A rather weird game, there are balls of three kinds, you can push them into other balls, two balls of the same color disappear,
two balls of different colors create a 'baby' of different color that you can eat to restore some energy or let it grow into a big ball,
balls explode when they live for too long time. You have to survive while balls need to disappear or explode. The time is very limited,
so it is challenging (although I do not remember the challenge as very fun).

You could consider North and South a kind of "real-time strategy game" or not... there are some similarities, there are some differences.
If you do, it is great because it did it much before the usual "classics" such as {Dune II}.
If you do not, well, it belongs to an interesting genre that does not seem that popular anymore.

GAME Hades

The developers of Hades did lot of damage by deciding to market this death loop as roguelike.
A roguelike fan would fit nothing interesting here, there are basically no non-trivial similarities to roguelikes.
Maybe it is a bit similar to {Hoplite} due to the theme of exploring the ancient Greek hell and getting boons from gods.
It is supposed to have a great story built around death loop, but I did not see this while playing for 1.5 hours
(of course actual roguelikes are not looped and may have great narratives like {Caves of Qud}, and {Baroque} did a death loop narrative in 1998).

This is a game building a narrative around a death loop -- as in, you play the game repeatedly, if you die, you return to the beginning.
So the idea is quite similar to what is commonly attributed to {Hades}, although done already in 1998! Also, contrary to Hades, it has obvious similarities
to roguelikes -- in particular, it has procedural generation and identification system similar to {Rogue} and Mystery Dungeon games. Unfortunately it does
not have the {tag:roguelike} system of controlling the flow of time, so I found it quite slow and boring, and played just a few runs.

GAME The Binding of Isaac
BY Edmund McMillen
VAL pc year=2011 played=2012 gem=-2 xp=1 weirdtheme roguelite topdown realtime dodger combat randomized procgen idminigame unlocks itemlock seq bossfights modalbattle flick hires ext secrets
I played this game expecting something similar to a roguelike, but I did not get it. No procedurally generated maps, no strategically picking whether or where you fight --
instead, rooms which lock their doors in combat. No items like in a normal RPG -- instead, arcade-ish upgrades. And, to mention the obvious, the gameplay is more like
{Zelda} than {Rogue}. So I found it a very bad game.

Unfortunately, this game became very popular with people who have never played a roguelike, and created a new genre... Apparently people now think that roguelikes do not have procedural
generation (but locked predesigned rooms and randomized upgrades) and that run-based gameplay is a defining feature of roguelikes. This sucks, basically.

A game/engine intending to be an open-source clone of {Diablo}, but as common with such open-source clones, I do not think there is much point to play that over the original.
(Better to play opensource games that are much better than commercial games, such as roguelikes.) Contrary to Diablo the flagship campaign is fixed.

GAME Fidel Dungeon Rescue
BY country: Argentina
VAL pc roguelike year=2017 xp=3 megaitch topdown combat turnbased grid orthogrid lores seq randomized logic animaltheme=2 played=2019 procgen
This game is listed as "roguelite" in its Steam description, although it is a roguelike according to my definition -- although definitely a very non-standard one,
and clearly one that would not fit some cultural expectations.
As you move, you leave your "dog leash" behind you, and you are allowed to "go backwards" to undo your moves, which makes it closer to puzzle standards, but
goes against the traditional roguelike focus on "permadeath". The puzzles are still procedurally generated, there is a linear campaign and there are also some
sets of levels outside of this campaign -- which are, interestingly, also randomized, and sometimes it is not actually possibly to win. Anyway, a not so famous
game that tests the boundaries of roguelikes.

GAME Monument Valley

A game based on impossible figures such as Penrose triangles (also commonly associated with Escher, although discovered earlier by Oscar Reutersvärd).
The developers wanted to create a game in which every individual screenshot is beautiful, and it shows -- it is a beautiful exploration game.
That is enough for my recommendation. However, do not expect good puzzles. The puzzles basically solve themselves.

I technically played it first in 2018 or so, but then, we wanted to play together, but failed to run it on Linux -- I think I found a way to play it, but it took us
until 2025 to actually play it.
A first-person shooter somewhat similar to roguelikes in that you control the flow of time (however, not exactly -- contrary to what the game says, the time still flows,
just very slowly, so that is a good excuse to not give it the {tag:turnbased}, {tag:pauseable}, or {tag:roguelike} tag). It is also similar to roguelikes in that its
distinctive graphical style is designed for clarity. I do not like being shot from behind (this one is contrary to most roguelikes; {Time4Cat} which was an inspiration for
Superhot was more similar). The construction is rather unique,
with an in-game simulation of a very simple operating system with some bonus demo files, which is important for its rather interesting story.
Strangely, it seems that the enemies' weapons are sometimes randomized, so it is not totally {tag:fixed}.
