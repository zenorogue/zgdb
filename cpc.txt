GAME Knight Lore
BY Ultimate Play the Game
VAL year=1985 played=1987 isometric realtime platformer cpc xp=2 gothic nonlinear lores fixed

One of isometric adventure games. It was cool but I have not played it that much, I think my casette stopped working.

GAME Roland in the Caves
BY Amsoft
VAL year=1984 played=1988 sideview realtime platformer cpc xp=2 hscroll vscroll medieval lores fixed seq

One of games about Roland (the mascot of Amstrad CPC). You need to escape a cave from some dragon-like creature. Not a very notable game.

GAME Roland in Space
BY Amsoft
VAL year=1985 played=1987 sideview realtime platformer cpc xp=3 scifi nonlinear hscroll vscroll lores fixed collectathon

A platformer in which you explored large scrolling levels to collect all the stuff. These huge levels were quite interesting, I preferred it to {Roland in Time}, for example.
Loved the Blue Danube music.

GAME Roland in Time
BY Amsoft
VAL year=1985 played=1987 sideview realtime platformer cpc xp=1 scifi nonlinear lores fixed collectathon

A platformer, a bit in the style of {Jet Set Willy}, but less cute, and with a time travel theme. I had not played it that much, I preferred {Roland in Space}, which had a more interesting world.

GAME Roland on Ropes
BY Amsoft
VAL year=1984 played=1988 realtime sideview cpc xp=4 pyramids hscroll vscroll lores fixed collectathon

A game where you explored a maze, finding treasures, fighting ghosts, and looking for the exit. I played it quite a lot, although today I do not think it was anything special.

GAME Roland Ahoy
BY Amsoft
VAL year=1984 played=1987 multiperspective topdown sideview realtime platformer cpc xp=3 pirate multigenre lores fixed overworld minigames

A game where you had a ship and had to collect gunpowder (while avoiding enemy fire), destroy a wall, collect treasure, and drop it off in your treasure cave. Rather repetitive.

GAME Killer Gorilla
VAL year=1984 played=1987 sideview realtime platformer cpc xp=2 lores fixed notheme seq
A clone of {Donkey Kong}. You had four platformer levels where you had to climb upwards to meet a big gorilla.

GAME Chuckie Egg
VAL year=1985 played=1987 sideview realtime platformer cpc xp=4 animaltheme lores fixed seq
A platformer with quite a few very interesting ideas. No fall damage, and you bounce off walls, so jumping from above to hit bottom platforms was quite unique.
Ostriches moving randomly. After 8 levels, they repeated, but now, there were more ostriches, or a big duck chasing you that could fly everywhere.
I played more {Chuckie Egg II}, but Chuckie Egg was interesting too.

GAME Snake
VAL year=1982 played=1987 sideview realtime grid cpc xp=2 abstract animaltheme=2 ascii randomized tiny orthogrid collectathon
A CPC version of the classic game, I think it is the most known from Nokia mobile phones.

GAME Planete Base
BY Loriciel
BY country: France
VAL year=1984 played=1986 cpc realtime xp=3 lores notheme multiperspective fixed minigames collectathon sciencegame
The first educational game I have played. This one is about positional number systems, you could exchange 3 fruits to 1 fruit of a higher tier, and thus learn
the ternary number system. I do not think it was very interesting, though.

GAME Ghostbusters
BY Activision
VAL year=1984 played=1987 cpc multiperspective sideview topdown realtime xp=2 gothic lores randomized metapower minigames multigenre economy
Great music (from the Ghostbusters movie). You had to supply your car, then find ghosts in the town and catch them (without crossing rays, or something). I think a bit too hard for me to understand back them.

TAGCMT metapower
I do not remember this from playing this game myself, but I read it has an option of starting with more money after "earning" them in previous runs.

GAME Oh Mummy
BY Amsoft
VAL year=1984 played=1986 cpc topdown realtime xp=3 pyramids lores randomized seq collectathon
A game a bit like {Pacman}, you had to surround rectangles with your footprints to 'explore' them, to find treasure, weapons, or extra mummies to chase you.
Quite a memorable music (called "Arabian riff"), also known from many other games.

GAME Weetabix versus the Titchies
VAL year=1984 played=1987 sideview realtime shooter cpc xp=2 lores weirdtheme fixed seq
A game in the style of {Space Invaders}, with a wide guy who promoted some Weetabix cereal. Quite fun.

GAME Er*Bert
VAL year=1984 played=1987 cpc xp=3 isometric realtime weirdtheme lores fixed seq collectathon
A clone of Q-Bert. I liked the isometric graphics, but I do not remember playing it much.

GAME Finders Keepers
BY Mastertronic
BY David Jones
VAL year=1986 played=1988 cpc xp=3 gem=1 multiperspective sideview realtime platformer topdown medieval multigenre hscroll vscroll nonlinear female lores fixed return itemuse economy
That was quite an interesting game, a proto-metroidvania of sorts. You explored some castles (like in a platformer) and also there was a top-down maze.
You could find (or buy) items that could be combined (pile of mud + spark of life = mud monster), used (mostly to permit movement), or sold to buy more important items.
(I list this as 'female protagonist' because that is apparently supposed to be the big reveal in the fifth game in the series, that is still in the works in 2025;
although the game manual refers to the Magic Knight as 'she'.)

GAME Pyjamarama
BY Mikro-Gen
VAL year=1984 played=1987 cpc xp=3 gem=1 sideview realtime platformer nonlinear moderntheme lores fixed itemuse flick
A proto-metroidvania. The world was basically a big house, you could find items that could be used for specific purposes, lots of weird stuff like going to Moon, you had to wake up your boss or something.

GAME Spellbound
BY Mastertronic
BY David Jones
VAL year=1986 played=1989 cpc xp=3 sideview realtime platformer medieval female lores fixed flick nonlinear return itemuse
A sequel to {Finders Keepers}. You explored a world with about 40 screens, found items, used them, talked to people. A bit too complex for me, I preferred {Finders Keepers}.

GAME Bridge-It
VAL year=1984 played=1987 cpc xp=2 realtime lores fixed=? otherlinear moderntheme tiny=? exp=?
A not very interesting game about a maze with bridges. (This is Bridge-It on CPC, not a sequel to {Bridge Builder} which I have not played.)

GAME Sultan's Maze
BY Amsoft
VAL year=1984 played=1990 cpc fpp xp=1 lores arabian=? slasher=? fixed=? camscroll realtime=?
An early first-person perspective game, although I have not played it that much.

GAME Gauntlet
BY Atari Games
VAL year=1984 played=1989 cpc xp=1 realtime topdown tolkien lores fixed seq multiplayer exp combat
I think I have played this famous game just once, with my brother. I probably should play it again...
Apparently it was a clone of much less well known Dandy Dungeon, and not procedurally generated only because the dev of Dandy Dungeon has not heard about Rogue.

GAME Manic Miner
BY Matthew Smith
VAL year=1984 played=1986 cpc xp=2 gem=2 sideview realtime platformer lores weirdtheme fixed seq collectathon
A classic 8-bit platformer, and a prequel to {Jet Set Willy}. A sequence of 20 levels. I had great fun playing {Manic Miner PC} around 1999.
For me it is the most canonical platformer, basically the analog of {Mario} for 8-bit computers. It was meant to be similar to {Donkey Kong},
but it became its own thing; still, some levels are clearly a reference.

GAME Fruity Frank
VAL year=1984 played=1986 cpc xp=1 topdown realtime lores animaltheme fixed seq collectathon
One of the first games I remember playing. A bit like {Digger}. Unfortunately the casette did not work well, so I have not played it that much.

GAME Alien 8
BY Ultimate Play the Game
VAL year=1985 played=1987 cpc xp=2 isometric realtime platformer scifi nonlinear lores fixed
I have played this isometric adventure platformer quite a lot, although not without much success, and not as much as {Sweevo's World}. true3

GAME Punchy
VAL year=1984 played=1988 cpc xp=2 sideview realtime platformer lores notheme fixed seq
A platformer with simple levels, you just had to go from left to right, avoiding holes.
After 4 levels you played the same 4 levels again 3 times more, but with extra difficulty like missiles flying above you.

GAME Macadam Bumper
BY country: France
VAL year=1985 played=1988 cpc xp=3 gem=1 sideview realtime physics platformer lores gambletheme fixed tiny leveleditor endless
A pinball game. The great thing about it was that you could design your own pinball tables (and save them). 

GAME Frogger
BY Konami
BY country: Japan
VAL year=1981 played=1989 cpc xp=1 topdown realtime animaltheme=2 lores fixed=? tiny dodger endless
A famous game, but I did not play it that much. (On CPC I think.)

GAME Argo Navis
VAL year=1985 played=1988 cpc xp=3 gem=1 sideview realtime platformer scifi multigenre nonlinear lores fixed collectathon exp
A platformer with about 40 screens, you had to collect glowing things, store it in a special screen, and return.
There were enemies to shoot and radar spots where the game became a simple flight simulator, for some weird reason.
It was good (and simple?) enough for me to win it.

GAME One Man and His Droid
BY Mastertronic
VAL year=1986 played=1989 cpc xp=3 gem=2 sideview realtime matching scifi hscroll vscroll lores fixed passsave destructible
One of my favorite games on CPC, Mastertronic did lots of great stuff. You controlled a robot with four powers, and
had to lead creatures to their goal in the correct order. There were 20 levels, and on higher levels you could find passwords which you
could enter to start from them.

GAME Blagger
VAL year=1984 played=1988 cpc xp=2 sideview realtime platformer lores notheme fixed seq collectathon
A game similar to {Manic Miner}, but not as good.

GAME Time Man One
VAL year=1984 played=1986 cpc xp=3 abstract lores sideview minigames turnbased randomized difflevels=? sciencegame
An educational game for children, you could learn to read a clock, nothing special.

GAME Jet Set Willy
BY Matthew Smith
VAL year=1985 played=1987 cpc sideview realtime platformer xp=1 nonlinear lores weirdtheme flick fixed collectathon
A famous 8-bit game, a platformer where you explored a big mansion.

GAME Spindizzy
VAL year=1986 played=1988 cpc realtime isometric physics xp=3 nonlinear abstract lores fixed flick exp gem=1
It was similar to Marble Madness (which seems to be remembered better).
An isometric game where you travelled through a bit world (over 200 screens)
and collected gems. A kind of a physics game.

GAME Hard Hat Mack
VAL year=1985 played=1987 cpc realtime sideview platformer xp=1 lores moderntheme fixed seq
A platformer a bit in the style of {Donkey Kong}, not interesting.

GAME Airwolf
BY Amsoft
VAL year=1985 played=1987 cpc realtime xp=2 military lores sideview fixed seq exp=?
A game where you played as a helicopter flying through some dungeon-ish mazes.
Hard and a bit weird, and not in the good way.
{Airwolf II} was more fun, although it was a more typical horizontal shmup.

GAME Sir Lancelot
VAL year=1984 played=1986 cpc xp=2 realtime sideview platformer medieval nonlinear lores overworld fixed collectathon overworld
A platformer with about 20 levels that you could play in any order. One of the first games I have played, but nothing special.
TAGCMT overworld
choice between rooms... I guess it is overworld enough

GAME Super Pipeline II
VAL year=1985 played=1987 cpc realtime gem=2 xp=3 moderntheme lores sideview fixed seq shooter
A game where you played as a guy moving on a pipeline whose job was to fix holes (the job was actually done by your two helpers),
there were various enemies who hurt you or damaged the pipes. After some levels there were cool animations.
I liked it quite a lot.

GAME Saboteur
VAL year=1986 played=1988 cpc realtime sideview xp=3 platformer eastern nonlinear slasher lores flick fixed
A platformer-ish where you played as a ninja, you had to set up a bomb or something. {Saboteur II} was cooler.

GAME Bruce Lee
BY Datasoft
VAL year=1984 played=1987 cpc gem=1 xp=3 realtime sideview platformer eastern slasher lores fixed nonlinear flick exp traps
Quite an interesting beat-em-up platformer. Quite a big world, with many screens with different challenges.
There were two opponents (knight-like and sumo-like), with two players one player could control the sumo.
I have won it.

GAME Rock Hopper
VAL year=1985 played=1986 cpc xp=3 logic turnbased sideview grid destructible abstract lores orthogrid fixed seq boulderdash
A puzzle game, a bit like {Boulder Dash} but turn-based.

GAME Chuckie Egg II
VAL year=1985 played=1988 cpc xp=4 realtime sideview platformer nonlinear lores animaltheme fixed flick itemuse collectathon exp manualsave gem=2
A proto-metroidvania with a huge map (120 levels) with platforming exploration, you had to collect items,
to create a chocolate egg, then carry that egg outside. There were also useful items such as ladder,
baskets or locks. I have played this quite a lot.

GAME View to a Kill
VAL year=1985 played=1989 cpc xp=2 realtime sideview platformer nonlinear moderntheme lores flick fixed itemuse exp
A weird proto-metroidvania game based on a James Bond movie.

GAME Highway Encounter
BY Vortex Software
VAL year=1985 played=1988 cpc xp=4 realtime isometric scifi hscroll gem=1 lores return randomized=? shooter blackboard
A yet another original isometric game from Mastertronic. You had to push a weapon through 30 levels,
you control one robot while your extra "lives" work as pushers. There were some enemies, so it was
a good idea to kill those first before letting your extra lives get exposed while pushing. 
I had quite a lot of fun playing it on an emulator. (I count it as a diagonal scrolling game -- while
the game skips from, say, zone 25 to zone 24 without continuous scrolling, the world is logically seamless.)

GAME Sweevo's World
BY Gargoyle Games
VAL year=1986 played=1988 cpc xp=3 realtime isometric gem=1 weirdtheme nonlinear lores fixed flick itemuse
An isometric almost-platformer with a rather large world. You could collect items and do fun things with them.
I played it quite a lot.

GAME Cauldron II
BY Palace Software
VAL year=1986 played=1988 cpc xp=3 realtime sideview platformer gem=2 nonlinear ability medieval lores fixed=? exp
That game was essentially a metroidvania. One unique thing was that you were a jumping pumpkin
that could shoot and also collect items (like axes or shields) which let you explore more of the castle,
so the movement was quite unique. It was fun to draw the map of the world to see a nice Halloween-style castle.
PNG cpc-cauldron2 Cauldron II screenshot

GAME Green Beret
BY Konami
VAL year=1986 played=1987 cpc xp=2 realtime sideview hscroll shooter military lores fixed bossfights=?
A game where you fight Russians as a member of American special forces. My mother did not like the war theme so I have not played it that much.

GAME Commando
BY Capcom
VAL year=1985 played=1989 cpc realtime shooter topdown xp=2 vscroll military lores fixed
A rather well-known shoot-em-up. I have not played it that much.

GAME Bomb Jack
VAL year=1986 played=1988 cpc realtime sideview platformer xp=2 lores notheme fixed seq
A platformer where you could jump quite high and had to collect all the bombs on the level. Nothing special.

GAME Fairlight
VAL year=1986 played=1988 cpc realtime isometric xp=2 medieval lores fixed flick nonlinear hscroll=? vscroll=? itemuse
This adventure game was rather strange.

GAME Cauldron
BY Palace Software
VAL year=1985 played=1988 cpc xp=3 realtime sideview platformer shooter multigenre hscroll female medieval lores overworld fixed overworld
You play as a witch who flies on a broom and shoots, and enters caves which play like a platformer. 
Did not play much, I preferred {Cauldron II}.

GAME Ghosts'n'Goblins
BY Capcom
VAL year=1986 played=1988 cpc xp=3 realtime sideview platformer hscroll medieval lores fixed
A game famous for being hard. Too hard to be fun.

GAME Roland Goes Digging
BY Amsoft
VAL year=1984 played=1988 cpc xp=3 gem=1 realtime sideview lores notheme fixed seq platformer traps
You are a guy with a spade who has to dig in the correct places to prevent enemies from catching him, and to make them die of falling.
Quite unique, one of my favorite games on CPC.

GAME Boulder Dash
BY Peter Liepa
VAL year=1985 played=1987 cpc xp=3 gem=2 grid orthogrid realtime sideview hscroll vscroll destructible lores notheme fixed collectathon traps boulderdash
A rather well-remembered 8-bit game, a bit like a grid puzzle, but it was an action game where precise timing matters.
Basically a genre that was perfected by the two games it had (Boulder Dash and {Supaplex}), so no more popular games were created in
that genre. Quite fun to learn that Peter Liepa later got interested in hyperbolic tessellations.
If you have not tried it, definetely recommended, although I have played more {Boulder Dash III} and {Boulder Dash Construction Kit}.

GAME Boulder Dash III
BY Peter Liepa
VAL year=1986 played=1988 cpc xp=3 realtime grid sideview scifi hscroll vscroll destructible lores fixed orthogrid seq collectathon traps boulderdash
Just like Boulder Dash but with a more sci-fi theme (only graphics were changed, I think there were no new items). I preferred it to the original {Boulder Dash}.

GAME Karl's Treasure Hunt
VAL year=1984 played=1989 cpc xp=4 realtime sideview platformer nonlinear lores notheme fixed collectathon exp
A Jet-Set-Willy-style platformer but easier, I have managed to collect all 40 keys from 40 screens and win, so it was more fun.

GAME Starquake
VAL year=1986 played=1990 cpc xp=2 gem=2 realtime sideview platformer scifi nonlinear shooter lores flick randomized exp blackboard
A very fun proto-metroidvania, with a huge world (about 100 screens), and lots of items you could use (codes, keys, quest items, etc.).

GAME Equinox
BY Mikro-Gen
VAL year=1986 played=1990 cpc xp=4 gem=1 realtime scifi lores sideview seq flick fixed collectathon
I remember this game well, you are a robot flying through 8 large levels. Very fun, I have actually won it.

GAME Batman
BY Ocean Software
VAL year=1986 played=1989 cpc xp=3 realtime isometric platformer superhero nonlinear lores fixed exp
One of isometric adventure platformers in the style of later {Head over Heels}. I would rather recommend Head over Heels.

GAME Caves of Doom
BY Mastertronic
VAL year=1985 played=1989 cpc xp=2 realtime sideview platformer scifi nonlinear lores leveleditor fixed exp
A rather strange platformer where you explored a large world. You could edit the map, so that was quite cool.

GAME Zorro
BY Datasoft
VAL year=1985 played=1988 cpc xp=4 realtime sideview platformer superhero lores fixed flick nonlinear return itemuse exp
A rather original adventure platformer. A bit similar to {Bruce Lee} but different theme.

GAME Three Weeks in Paradise
BY Mikro-Gen
VAL year=1986 played=1988 cpc xp=2 realtime sideview nonlinear lores weirdtheme fixed itemuse
A sequel to {Pyjamarama} where you are stranded on an island, I remember Pyjamarama better.

GAME Munch-It
VAL year=1985 played=1987 cpc xp=3 realtime topdown lores notheme fixed seq collectathon
A {Pacman} clone.

GAME Gunfright
BY Ultimate Play the Game
VAL year=1986 played=1987 cpc xp=3 isometric realtime shooter western hscroll vscroll lores seq randomized=? modalbattle
A game where you walked in isometric perspective until you found an outlaw. Then the game changed into a shootout scene where you had to aim at the outlaw and shoot first. 
A bit unique, although nothing special.

GAME Tales of the Arabian Nights
VAL year=1985 played=1987 cpc xp=1 realtime sideview platformer arabian lores fixed seq collectathon=?
A not very notable platformer.

GAME Killapede
BY Activision
VAL year=1986 played=1987 cpc xp=1 realtime animaltheme shooter lores topdown randomized tiny
A clone of {Centipede}. Do not remember much about it, other than that there was a long centipede walking on the screen that you could shoot.

GAME Ikari Warriors
VAL year=1986 played=1987 cpc xp=2 realtime topdown shooter vscroll military lores fixed multiplayer
A fun game in the style of {Commando}.

GAME Saboteur II
VAL year=1987 played=1992 cpc realtime sideview platformer xp=5 gem=2 nonlinear eastern slasher female lores fixed passsave difflevels exp
This game should be more well known, many people remember {Metroid} for its female protagonist, but Saboteur II was IMO much more notable for that, because she was clearly a woman all the time.
Quite a large world, about 100 screens, maybe more. A proto-metroidvania, although not much character progression.
After winning you could enter the code to play again, but this time it was harder (you had to disable more security, collect more codes, etc.)
I have played it until I have finished the late levels (although there was some cheat, I do not remember whether I have used it).
Great SID music by Rob Hubbard that years later I have found and put on my music player. (I have seen some claims that the music was written but not actually used in the game,
which was clearly false, so maybe non-CPC versions did not include it?)
PNG cpc-saboteur2 Saboteur II screenshot

GAME Chimera
BY Firebird
VAL year=1985 played=1992 cpc realtime isometric xp=2 scifi lores fixed flick nonlinear itemuse
An isometric adventure, nothing special.

GAME Impossible Mission
BY Epyx
VAL year=1986 played=1990 cpc realtime sideview platformer nonlinear randomized xp=3 gem=1 moderntheme lores flick exp
An example of an early non-roguelike game inspired by {Rogue} -- it randomized the layout of its rooms. Apparently very popular back then, but mostly forgotten.

GAME Hero of the Golden Talisman
BY Mastertronic
VAL year=1986 played=1992 cpc realtime sideview platformer nonlinear=0 xp=4 gem=1 shooter lores notheme fixed itemuse exp
Wikipedia describes this game as 'Metroidvania', I do not think I agree (it was mostly linear), but still a proto-metroidvania. 
You explored a large complex of caves, shot monsters, collected items that let you proceed further (keys, candles, special weapons). Quite cool, I have won
it many times. (Although the version I have played apparently had its map changed slightly, letting you skip like half of the game.)

GAME Rebelstar
BY Julian Gollop
BY Firebird
VAL year=1986 played=1992 cpc turnbased topdown grid xp=4 gem=3 scifi nonlinear hscroll vscroll shooter squad lores diagrid fixed difflevels multiweapon multiplayer shapegfx
One of my favorite games on CPC. This later evolved into {XCOM} / UFO, made by the same developer, Julian Gollop. 
While Rebelstar was quite primitive compared to XCOM, being a single mission with basic AI, it had lots of its charm, like
the 'shooting mode' where the enemies were replaced with circles and you had to hit these circles with a straight line.
Quite complex simulation, with stamina, items, and so on. See {Archrebel Tactics} for a modern take, it seems very good.
PNG cpc-rebelstar Rebelstar screenshot

GAME Arkanoid
BY Taito
BY country: Japan
VAL year=1987 played=1988 cpc realtime physics xp=3 gem=1 scifi lores seq sideview fixed shooter
A rather famous game, I think I wanted to play it more than I played it (I think the casette did not work well).
You had to bounce a ball at a wall, you had to destroy the whole wall like that, sometimes you got special power-ups
like glue or triple ball (as far as I know, this was a cool improvement over the original {Breakout}), 
and some enemies that the ball could hit.
I also remember playing (or watching) a variant with more interesting powers like more powerful "bomb" balls, but only once.
(Not sure what it was -- I remember the name as Arkanoid II, so probably it was Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh.)

GAME Prohibition
VAL year=1986 played=1987 cpc realtime shooter xp=1 moderntheme lores sideview fixed hscroll
A game where you could see gangsters in windows and you had to shoot them before they shot you, I do not think there was more to it.

GAME Airwolf II
VAL year=1987 played=1990 cpc realtime shooter xp=3 scifi hscroll autoscroll military lores sideview fixed multiweapon bossfights=? gem=1
An early shmup I remember the best. I think it was more cool than {R-Type}.

GAME 3DC
VAL year=1987 played=1991 cpc isometric xp=2 realtime aquatic lores flick nonlinear fixed return itemuse blackboard secrets=?
Yet another isometric adventure.

GAME Deflektor
BY Vortex Software
VAL year=1987 played=1992 cpc gem=2 realtime physics shooter grid xp=3 abstract lores diagrid topdown fixed seq blackboard
An action puzzle where you could control mirrors and you had to hit targets with a laser beam. Very fun.

GAME Krakout
BY Gremlin Graphics
VAL year=1987 played=1988 cpc realtime physics xp=3 gem=1 abstract lores sideview fixed seq
A clone of {Arkanoid}, but with a horizontal layout. 
Quite fun, it had more interesting powers/creatures than Arkanoid. Lots of levels.
So while Arkanoid is more classic, Krakout is more interesting.

GAME Metro-Cross
BY Namco
VAL year=1987 played=1989 cpc realtime hscroll racing xp=3 sports lores autoscroll sideview platformer fixed seq
A racing game where you skate. It was quite cool.

GAME Amazing Shriking Man
VAL year=1986 played=1989 cpc realtime sideview platformer xp=2 hscroll vscroll weirdtheme lores fixed itemuse exp traps rulediscovery=?
A rather weird game where you were a tiny man in some trash and could collect items and do some things.

GAME Venom Strikes Back
VAL year=1988 played=1989 cpc realtime sideview platformer racing xp=3 scifi hscroll shooter lores fixed seq multiweapon exp secrets
A platformer. I remember there was some huge rocket that we did not know how to go through.

GAME Cybernoid
VAL year=1988 played=1989 cpc realtime sideview xp=1 scifi lores flick fixed shooter=?
A game where you guided a flying robot through a maze. Not remember much.

GAME Boulder Dash Construction Kit
BY Peter Liepa
VAL year=1986 played=1990 cpc realtime grid sideview xp=3 gem=2 hscroll vscroll destructible lores leveleditor orthogrid notheme fixed traps boulderdash
A game where you could create your own {Boulder Dash} levels! How cool is that?!

GAME Head over Heels
BY Ocean Software
VAL year=1987 played=1992 cpc realtime isometric platformer nonlinear xp=3 gem=2 lores weirdtheme fixed flick squad exp
An isometric adventure. This one was especially notable because you controlled two characters
with distinct powers; that was quite unique. You could also put Head over Heels to make them go
together as a single entity.
PNG cpc-hoh Head over Heels screenshot

GAME Alien Highway
BY Vortex Software
VAL year=1986 played=1992 cpc realtime isometric xp=3 scifi hscroll randomized gem=1 shooter lores blackboard
A sequel to {Highway Encounter}. One unique thing about Highway Encounter (your spare lives pushing the thing automatically)
is no longer true here, you just push yourself. On the other hand, this game was made more interesting by ordering the zones randomly.

GAME Ramparts
BY Atari Games
VAL year=1988 played=1989 cpc realtime sideview xp=2 medieval lores fixed seq dodger multiplayer=?
I think it was a clone of an arcade game. You were a giant punching walls to bring towers down.
Was definitely fun, but I could not play it that much.

GAME Pac-land
BY Namco
VAL year=1989 played=1989 cpc realtime xp=2 gothic hscroll lores platformer sideview seq fixed
I do not remember much about this one, there was some huge lake and I did not know how to proceed.

GAME Mange Cailloux
BY Loriciel
VAL year=1987 played=1988 cpc realtime grid xp=2 lores diagrid=? notheme topdown randomized=? seq boulderdash
I think it was a clone of an arcade game called Pango. Levels are filled with blocks that you could push to attack monsters.

GAME Zub
BY Mastertronic
VAL year=1986 played=1988 cpc realtime sideview platformer xp=4 scifi weirdtheme hscroll vscroll lores fixed blackboard gem=2
An original game that I have played quite a lot. You had to use platforms to climb the sky, you had to move the platforms if they were not aligned correctly with the higher ones.
Featured lots of weird text on the intro screen (and in other places). Cool music by David Whittaker.

GAME Ranarama
VAL year=1987 played=1992 cpc realtime topdown shooter xp=4 gem=3 medieval nonlinear lores fixed secrets
A very cool and original game that I still play from time to time. You are a frog (or rather a wizard turned into a frog). You could cast spells, to do that you had to collect runes
by battling wizards in a mental battle (in which you had to order the 'ranarama' letters to win), and then you need to use a collection of runes to cast a spell which gave
you better offense/defense/special ability/power. I still play that from time to time. There is a remake from 2008 but I prefer the original.

GAME R-Type
VAL year=1988 played=1989 cpc realtime shooter xp=2 scifi hscroll autoscroll lores sideview fixed multiweapon=?
A well known shmup that I do not remember much, I preferred {Airwolf II} in the same style.

GAME Defend or Die
VAL shooter sideview hscroll year=1981 played=1990 gem=1 scifi xp=1 realtime lores fixed
A {Defender} clone.

An example of a metroidvania from before {Metroid}; it was notable for that reason.
I remember watching my brother play it; I have also tried a PC remake, but it was not that great,  the control was not very nice.

GAME Splat!
BY Amsoft
VAL year=1985 played=1993 cpc realtime xp=4 gem=1 topdown grid weirdtheme hscroll vscroll autoscroll lores orthogrid fixed traps dodger
A game where you controlled some spider-like creature. A rather large map, the view scrolls in two dimensions, so you could only see a small window.
However, that scrolling was automatic, and you had to keep your spider-like creature inside the view, avoiding the maze-like obstacles.
As far as I recall, the first seven levels progressed through the map in steps, while the eighth level was about going back to the start in a straight line.
There were some weird stuff like some things sometimes being of wrong color and thus acting differently (for example, green grass normally increased your score and black walls 
blocked your movement but black grass blocked and green squares increased score), or things changing color on their own (you get the idea, you had to hit the right color).

GAME Zolyx
VAL cpc year=1987 gem=1 xp=2 played=1988 cpc topdown realtime abstract pixelsim randomized seq endless shapegfx dodger
A game with a large open area with some enemies, you had to go through that area without an enemy hitting you or your path, after crossing the line would become "solid"
and any area without enemies would become a part of your score. Later such games got referred to as Xonix, so I thought Xonix was an original, but apparently the
original was {Qix} and Zolyx and {Xonix} were clones of it.

GAME Diamond Digger
VAL pc year=1986 played=1987 sideview cpc xp=1 realtime destructible lores notheme spacebending fixed seq collectathon boulderdash
A bit similar to {Boulder Dash} or {Rock Hopper}, in that you had to collect treasures and avoid falling rocks. In this game, the rocks would fall quite easily, so you would die
if you were on the way of a rock falling downwards or rolling left or right (contrary to Boulder Dash where you could temporarily block such a rock with your character).
However, one thing made it different: you had an ability to scroll a whole row left or right, and you had to use that to collect e.g. diamonds just below rocks. That made it a bit of
a logic game (with limited time). Interesting, but I do not remember playing it much. My brother said that he has written it (or I misinterpreted, I found it fishy anyway -- I see it
was a type-in game, so I think he just typed it in).

You search furniture for stuff, so it counts as exploration I guess.

I have found this game in a collection of emulated CPC games, and the title looked weird, so I checked it out. A simulation of Poker against some lady who ultimately turns out to be a robot.
Always funny to find people who thought that displaying this kind of graphics would be a good use of CPC's rather crude capabilities.

Basically a computer adaptation of a popular pencil-and-paper game about placing your ships on a grid and then guessing where your enemy put their ships.
With some cool graphics, you would see actual cannonballs flying at the enemy ships (but somehow you would actually see these skips in these graphics, so
couldn't you just aim at them instead of guessing?...)

some adventure elements, although I mostly remember only that there was a character named Pita.

(this one was not that great actually).

GAME Ring of Darkness
VAL cpc year=1985 played=1999 medieval lores xp=3 topdown slasher fixed overworld seq realtime exp
I have not played it on Amstrad CPC originally, but somehow it was among the games I have played later on an emulator. Not sure why I have picked it, maybe 
I wanted to play something similar to a roguelike? It feels quite similar to {Ultima} which I have not played then, and CRPG Addict confirms that, also saying
that Ultima was not known in Europe, which also agrees with my experiences.

GAME Sapiens
BY country: France
VAL cpc year=1986 played=1989 multiperspective gem=2 prehistoric xp=1 lores openworld survival fixed procgen economy realtime sciencegame
While making this site, I remembered playing/seeing a game on Amstrad CPC where you were some kind of a caveman, and one of the things you could do was to create
stone tools by hitting a piece of flint in correct locations... did not remember the name at first...so yeah, Sapiens was that.

From what I read now, it looks like a very ambitious and original game for its time:
survival mechanics, multiple perspectives (both 3D and sideview), procedurally generated maps with fractal trees, manage your tribe. So basically a more
historically accurate predecessor of {Minecraft}. Somehow the wikipedia article lists only {UnReal World} as a predecessor of the survival genre. I have not
really played this, but it looks like something that should be more well known. The original Amstrad CPC version is probably too old and ugly to be enjoyable, 
but apparently there is a remake for modern systems <a href="https://www.myriad-online.com/en/products/sapiens.htm">here</a>.
