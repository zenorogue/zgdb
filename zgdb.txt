ABOUT

This is Zeno Rogue's personal game review site / database.

It started from a idea of creating a better review site.  I do review the games I play on Steam, but I realized that this is not really enough, since
not every game I play is on Steam (or I play it on Steam).

And my Steam collection of games is biased. This is important, because the perceived history of games is largely shaped by various people trying to influence
the perception in ways that profit them.
Some examples of that would be the erasure of 8-bit computer (in favor of consoles) and the related American tale of how Nintendo "saves the game industry"
(while around here Nintendo mostly did not exist and we had lots of fun playing on 8-bit computers), pushing 'indie' as a revolution happening around 2010
(while small, independent games always existed, such as Flash or shareware games), and the erasure of {tag:roguelike}s (until the 'indie revolution' started using
the word for something competely different). This site attempts to present an exhaustive list of the games I have played -- if I remember playing it,
and something about it, it is probably included.

Since I have been always more interested in these more niche games, it is biased towards them, so you use it to find lots of forgotten games.

I am also very interested in the categorization of games, and especially games that feature uncommon combinations of features. As such, the site also includes
an extensive collection of detailed tags and an advanced search feature where you can define any formula. Various game design {tag:philosophies} do not appear
as tags but are split into their individual components, so you can find, for example, turn-based platformers, non-randomized roguelikes, or metroidvania-ish
games with a bit different features.

To combat the cultural imperialism of the Anglosphere, games from other countries are highlighted. (Games from {by:country:Australia} are marked despite them
being usually considered a part of the Anglosphere, and so are games by {by:country:Japan} despite big Japanese video game companies also being quite dominant in US.)

My reviews gives facts about the games that I consider interesting. The {tag:gem} tag can be used to find games that I think are less popular or well-known than they should. 

This is an <a href="https://github.com/zenorogue/zgdb">open source</a> project, so if you want to make a similar database for yourself,
suggest improvements, fix inaccurate data, analyze the data, use the database to teach students about databases, or whatever, feel free to do so.

Have fun!

<h2>The search system</h2>
The search system is able to parse formulae. Here are some examples of things you could enter in the search:
<ul>
<li> <tt>title:Rogue</tt> in "filter" for games with <tt>Rogue</tt> in title
<li> <tt>text:permadeath</tt> in "filter" for games with <tt>permadeath</tt> in text
<li> <tt>roguelike and not turnbased</tt> in "filter" to list games tagged with <tt>roguelike</tt> but not with <tt>turnbased</tt>
<li> <tt>images</tt> is the number of images, <tt>spoilers</tt> is the number of spoilers
<li> <tt>platformer*2+return*5+nonlinear*4+sideview*2+gothic*0.5</tt> in "sorting", {metroidvania} elements with example weights
<li> <tt>played-year</tt> in "sorting", to sort games by the approximate amount of time between release and when I tried them (if entered in "filter", it will list games for which this difference is positive)
<li> <tt>linked(1)</tt> in "sorting" to sort games by the number of times they are linked to
<li> <tt>links(turnbased)</tt> in "sorting" to sort games by the number of links to turn-based games
<li> <tt>like(title:metroidvania)</tt> in "sorting" to find games similar to the {metroidvania philosophy}
(what you put inside "like" is in general a filter, here it matches only "metroidvania philosophy"; 
the way it works: for every game <i>h</i>, we sum the similarity score between the evaluated game and <i>h</i>, multiplied by the value of the given filter for <i>h</i>; the similarity score is the sum of products of the values of every tag for both games, except "meta" and "subjective" tags)
<li> <tt>unknown:tag</tt> to check if the tag is unknown, <tt>def:tag</tt> to check if the tag is defined, <tt>by:community</tt> to list games by community
<li> <tt>roguelike and red or roguelite and blue or white</tt> in "coloring", to color roguelikes red and roguelites blue
</ul>
