Diablo is usually credited as an inventor of the ARPG genre, but it should be called Action Roguelike instead,
as the first extremely successful game that was very similar to roguelikes (specifically {Angband}) but replaced
the deep turn-based gameplay of roguelikes with action. There were isometric action RPGs before Diablo, for
example I have played {Son of the Empire} before it (I also played {FTA2} but that was after-Diablo).
People who knew what roguelikes were called Diablo roguelike, it was also one of the "roguelikes" that
Edmund McMillen played before creating {The Binding of Isaac}; but after that game was created,
the buzzword understanding was all about permadeath, and the roguelike community
became more strict on turn-based games. (And permadeath was in fact intended -- I have played without permadeath,
so I cannot give xp=4 for it). I like Diablo more than {Diablo II}.

GAME Iji
BY Daniel Remar
BY country: Sweden
VAL year=2008 played=2009 free realtime platformer sideview hscroll vscroll return female scifi pc xp=4 gem=3 multiweapon fixed vectorart free bossfights ammolimit=? rulediscovery ability secrets
In my opinion, this freeware platformer gem is best played if you do not know what to expect, so I will not explain why I love this game.
I have downloaded it in the evening played it for the whole night, and then, wanted to play it again immediately.
Anyway, quite an interesting take on the metroidvania-ish feature of backtracking -- the structure is linear, but if you are like me,
you will want to play it again to find the secrets you missed.

SPOILER
The most interesting thing about the game is its subversion of typical player expectations. In a typical RPG you kill
all the monsters for XP. You can do this in Iji too, but if you do, it will make you question your choice --
the game reminds you via its 'logs' that maybe killing so many monsters means that you are not actually that
a good person, and also it is easy to notice that killing these monsters were indeed your choice. So after
playing the game for the first game like that, I wanted to play again as a pacifist, and the game was much
nicer that way. Especially that you know that what you have is essentially the best weapon in the known
universe and you choose not to use it for moral reasons... There are also other subversions, like parodies
of the "completionist" approach where you do everything possible in a game.

GAME Cave Story
BY Pixel
VAL year=2004 played=2007 free realtime platformer sideview hscroll vscroll shooter return pc xp=4 gem=1 uniquetheme fixed lores anime multiweapon exp multiweapon bossfights ammolimit
This is a famous game that showed everyone that good metroidvania-ish games are not only created
by big console devs; I am a PC player, so it was one of the first metroidvania-ish game I have played.
The original Cave Story was free, there are some paid version too. It feels overshadowed by more modern
games such as {Hollow Knight} so I still feel it deserves a gem point. It does have lots of metroidvania
feel although it is quite linear (but sometimes you find cool things by returning to old places).

GAME Jet Set Willy PC
VAL year=1999 played=2000 free realtime sideview platformer pc xp=2 weirdtheme moderntheme fixed flick lores collectathon exp nonlinear
A PC remake of {Jet Set Willy}, with multiple level sets. I have not played it as much as {Manic Miner PC}.

GAME Llamatron
BY Jeff Minter
VAL year=1991 played=1994 pc xp=4 weirdtheme scifi animaltheme shooter topdown gem=1 fixed seq lores realtime multiplayer
A game with a weird sci-fi animal theme, with lots of llamas and sheep to protect, and Mandelbrot sets shooting you.
Great gameplay! I think it was heavily inspired by Robotron but I have not played that one. Quite a lot of people
remember it for its weird theme, probably even more should.

GAME Mortuum
VAL year=1995 played=1998 topdown slasher xp=4 gem=2 physics medieval pc fixed twistpixel seq multiweapon realtime
A topdown arcade game about a guy slaying enemies with their sword (or later, other weapons), made using Klik & Play.
It definitely counts as a hidden gem -- I do not hear anyone talking about it, but I had great fun with it
myself. What made it interesting was the physics-based weapon mechanics -- you did the most damage not by simply
sticking your weapons into the enemies, but by swinging them so that it had lots of momentum.

GAME Dune II
BY Westwood Studios
VAL year=1992 played=2000 pc topdown xp=3 scifi realtime army seq fixed lores economy multicampaign manualsave defense
A well-known game that started the modern RTS genre. I have played it after playing {Warcraft} (and I liked Warcraft more).
Also not at all similar to the first {Dune} game, which was a rather unique game.

GAME Stars!
AKA Stars
VAL year=1995 played=1995 pc turnbased xxxx xp=3 scifi gem=1 army procgen randomized hscroll vscroll shapegfx topdown multiplayer economy manualsave nonlinear difflevels=?
Stars! is a scifi 4X game that probably should be remembered more. You design your own ships by choosing the components to install
on hulls, very fun. A nice research system where you do not study specific technologies, but areas, for example to
install more powerful Missile weapons, you need to study Weapons and Propulsion technology.

GAME Wolfenstein 3D
BY id Software
BY John Carmack
BY John Romero
VAL year=1992 shooter fpp pc military fixed seq twistpixel xp=0 realtime ammolimit=?
I have not played Wolfenstein 3D (or earlier Wolfenstein games), but it is a bit strange how 
{Doom} is credited as the canonical early first-person shooter when Wolfenstein 3D was popular before it.

GAME Doom
BY id Software
BY John Carmack
BY John Romero
VAL year=1993 shooter fpp scifi helltheme pc xp=0 fixed seq models twistpixel multiplayer realtime ammolimit secrets
I have played only {Doom II}.
TAGCMT models
AFAIK the graphics were actually made from 3D models and turned into sprites which become twisted, so both {tag:models} and {tag:twistpixel} tags.

GAME Doom II
BY id Software
BY John Carmack
BY John Romero
VAL year=1994 played=1997 shooter fpp scifi helltheme xp=3 pc fixed seq models twistpixel multiplayer realtime ammolimit secrets
A very famous game, so of course I have played it. Although I have never been too much interested in first-person shooters, and it
had too much blood for me.

GAME Worms
BY Team17
VAL year=1995 gem=-1 semiturnbased hscroll vscroll shooter physics animaltheme weirdtheme sideview pc military platformer xp=0 procgen=? lores pixelsim destructible multiplayer multiweapon randomized=? ammolimit squad
My friends have played this game a lot in school. I did not like it, I found it inferior to the classic shareware game
{Scorched Earth} in similar style (tanks made more sense...), and the game {Bum} I have been designing at that time on my own.

GAME Gorillas
BY Microsoft
VAL year=1990 played=1992 turnbased shooter physics sideview pc animaltheme destructible pixelsim xp=3 randomized tiny lores free mono
This was an artillery game distributed with MS-DOS, in the style of {Scorched Earth} or {Worms}, as an example of a BASIC program.

GAME Nibbles
BY Microsoft
VAL year=1991 played=1995 turnbased shooter physics sideview pc abstract shapegfx seq multiplayer fixed multiplayer xp=2 mono
Yet another example game written in BASIC and distributed with MS-DOS, in the style of {Snake}, but multi-player and with multiple levels.
It was quite fun to play multiplayer.

GAME Transcendence
VAL year=1995 played=2008 scifi randomized hscroll vscroll nonlinear shooter realtime topdown xp=3 gem=1 aliens roguelite hires manualsave spaceopera return intrapower=?
A space-opera topdown shooter with clear {Rogue} inspirations, such as randomized star systems and various kind of equipment requiring identification.
Should be more well-known as an early game putting such things in something very different than a literal roguelike.

GAME Typing of the Dead
VAL year=2000 played=2006 gem=1 gothic wordgame fpp pc xp=4 fixed=? seq models realtime quickkey
A modification of the arcade game House of the Dead. While in the original you shot zombies with a gun, here you defeat them by typing words.
A very interesting way to create unique games!

GAME Worms II
BY Team17
VAL year=1997 played=2001 semiturnbased hscroll vscroll shooter physics animaltheme weirdtheme sideview pc military platformer seq xp=3 pixelsim destructible lores procgen=? randomized=? multiweapon ammolimit squad
A sequel to {Worms} that I enjoyed more than {Worms}, but still not as much as the real-time {Liero}.

GAME Arcade Volleyball
VAL year=1989 played=1992 pc sports sideview physics abstract platformer lores xp=4 fixed tiny realtime blackboard multiplayer
One of the first two games that were installed on my first DOS PC. 
A volleyball-style game with one guy in every team and the ball reflecting off walls. 
I have played the PC version, apparently the C64 original was quite different, with two guys per team.

GAME Blobby Volley
VAL year=2000 played=2000 pc sports free sideview physics abstract platformer lores=? xp=1 fixed tiny realtime multiplayer
A clone of {Arcade Volleyball} with nicer graphics. I preferred the original.

GAME Civilization
BY Sid Meier
BY MicroProse
VAL year=1991 played=1993 pc grid turnbased xxxx xp=4 hscroll vscroll history randomized nonlinear procgen hexgrid topdown lores economy army manualsave difflevels
This is of course a famous series of games that everybody should play. 
The classic 4X game, I have played it quite a lot. Everyone knows it, so not much point to talk much about it.

I have found some interesting bugs that do not
seem talked about: if you had two ships you could abuse the mechanics of 'unload' command giving full movement to all sentry units to travel as
far as you want in a single turn; and you could also do Settlers work in a single turn. (Somehow lots of people talk about the 'nuclear Gandhi'
bug, which apparently is just an urban legend.)

It uses a distinctive graphical style that makes the game look similar to board games: units have rectangles in the backgrounds which tell
which player they belong to. It fell out of fashion, mostly all current games use a more "realistic" graphical style where units
are just superimposed over the background terrain, and you need to look at the colors of their uniforms to tell the side. But I think it was cool.

GAME Civilization III
BY Sid Meier
BY MicroProse
VAL year=2001 played=2003 pc grid turnbased xxxx xp=4 hscroll vscroll history randomized nonlinear procgen hexgrid isometric midres economy army manualsave
I think it is in general an improvement over the original {Civilization}, however,
when I played this, I have been more of a roguelike fan, so controlling an army and micromanagement did not feel that fun.

GAME Dangerous Dave
BY John Romero
VAL year=1988 played=1992 sideview platformer realtime xp=4 hscroll notheme fixed seq hscroll lores
A classic platformer in the style of {Mario}.
I liked it, although I think it is mostly interesting for historical reasons, as it was created by John Romero who later became famous for {Doom}. 

GAME Earthworm Jim
VAL year=1994 played=1993 pc sideview platformer realtime hscroll scifi vscroll gem=1 xp=3 fixed lores exp
One of the early good platformers available on PC. It had a quite high variety of levels and things to do.

GAME Fool's Errand
VAL year=1987 played=2003 pc riddles logic xp=3 uniquetheme topdown fixed lores timeless rulediscovery=? picklevel=?
A kind of Tarot-themed riddle/puzzle game, I think I read about it on Home of the Underdogs. I do not remember much about it.

GAME Son of the Empire
VAL year=1993 played=1996 isometric gem=2 xp=4 engineering medieval lores fixed flick overworld rpgstats rpgequip rpgconsume pauseable nonlinear intrapower
I think this should be more well-known because of being an isometric action RPG, well before {Diablo}. 
You control a team of 4 characters, mostly going through dungeons, fighting monsters and collecting loot;
also an overworld map where they could visit further dungeons and towns to sell/buy stuff, or fight armies.
A very interesting spellcasting system where you could construct spells out of components, for example
Surround-Missile-Paralyze to shoot a paralyzing missile in each of 8 directions; this is the model of
"programmable magic" to me, instead of {Magicka} or {Noita}. The dungeons have some puzzles where you
need to cast a correct combination of runes so that you reach specific spots with a specific spell.
Otherwise than being an isometric action RPG, not very similar to Diablo, for example, the dungeons
are not randomized. This is a sequel to {Legend}.

GAME Legend
VAL year=1992 played=2016 isometric xp=3 engineering medieval lores fixed flick overworld rpgstats rpgequip rpgconsume pauseable intrapower
I have played a lot of its sequel, {Son of the Empire}, but I have eventually tried the original too.
They are very similar, although Son of the Empire fixed a few minor flaws, so I would recommend
that.

GAME Prehistorik
BY Titus
BY country: France
VAL year=1991 played=1994 atarist realtime platformer sideview prehistoric xp=2 fixed seq hscroll lores secrets=?
A caveman-themed platformer that I remember playing with my friend on Atari ST. I played more {Prehistorik II}.

GAME Prehistorik II
BY Titus
BY country: France
VAL year=1993 played=1995 hscroll vscroll realtime platformer sideview prehistoric xp=3 fixed seq hscroll vscroll lores exp secrets gem=2
A caveman-themed platformer, a sequel to {Prehistorik} with more sophisticated levels. Still fun!

GAME Digger
VAL year=1983 played=1991 sideview gem=2 destructible realtime shooter xp=2 fixed seq lores notheme traps boulderdash
One of the first PC games I have played. Very loosely similar to {Boulder Dash}, you explore a level
filled with diggable terrain, with some gems to collect, and bags of gold to drop on enemies (and to
collect gold if thrown from a height). Monsters become more powerful when two cross their paths, 
so there was some strategy in avoiding that.

GAME Tristan
VAL year=1991 played=1995 physics sideview platformer medieval xp=2 fixed tiny lores=? realtime
A pinball game I have played. But I do not remember much.

GAME Neverhood
VAL year=1997 played=2005 weirdtheme xp=3 uniquetheme riddles uniquegfx sideview fixed connections return timeless
A point-and-click adventure made of clay. I do not remember much.

GAME Polanie
VAL year=1996 played=2012 hscroll vscroll realtime xp=3 medieval army grid diagrid topdown fixed seq lores realtime exp combat
BY country: Poland
Basically a Polish clone of {Warcraft}.

GAME Jill of the Jungle
VAL year=1992 played=1993 realtime platformer hscroll vscroll female animaltheme gem=1 shareware xp=3 overworld sideview fixed lores overworld manualsave=? multiweapon
BY Epic
A platformer by Epic MegaGames. Notable features: animal theme, 
the 'jungle map' hub which worked the same way as the actual levels, you could
find magical runes turning you into various animals such as flaming birds or fish, 
a quite interesting knife weapon which could be controlled after being thrown,
news articles you could find during the game (most of which would be about various
characters from other games going bankrupt as a result of Jill's popularity).
The control was not very smooth (as I noticed when replaying the game recently),
but quite a lot of other cool stuff. I have tried the full trilogy later, but
I do not remember mostly anything (other than Jill changing the color of her
clothes, playing as a frog, and the 'jungle map' no longer working the same way).

GAME UGH
VAL year=1992 played=2003 realtime prehistoric xp=3 matching topdown fixed seq lores multiplayer
A game where you work as a flying taxicab for cavemen. 
I think I found it on Home of the Underdogs. Could be played with two players.

GAME Commander Keen
BY id Software
BY John Romero
BY John Carmack
VAL year=1990 played=1991 platformer hscroll vscroll realtime sideview shareware pc scifi xp=3 overworld fixed lores manualsave=? ammolimit nonlinear intrapower
One of shareware PC platformer classics. It is a start of a shareware trilogy
(possibly I have tried the sequels later but I do not remember anything about them).
It was the first CK game I have played, but somehow lost it later.
I have played more of {Commander Keen IV}.

GAME Commander Keen IV
BY id Software
BY John Romero
BY John Carmack
VAL year=1991 played=1994 platformer hscroll vscroll realtime sideview shareware pc scifi gem=1 xp=3 overworld fixed lores exp manualsave=? secrets nonlinear intrapower
The first game in the second {Commander Keen} trilogy. I have played this one quite a lot.
More interesting monsters and nicer graphics than in the original CK. 
The famous Dopefish enemy.
Many platforming areas you could reach from the world map. 
Shareware games seem rarely talked about nowadays, so I can give it a gem score.

GAME Hocus Pocus
BY Apogee Software
VAL year=1994 played=1995 platformer hscroll vscroll realtime sideview shareware pc xp=3 medieval fixed lores
A {Commander Keen}-style platformer, I played the first game of this shareware tetralogy.
I do not think there was anything notable about it, after {Commander Keen IV} and {Jill of the Jungle}.

GAME Duke Nukem
BY Apogee Software
VAL year=1991 shareware played=1994 platformer hscroll vscroll realtime sideview shareware pc scifi xp=3 scifi military fixed lores exp shooter
A competition to {Commander Keen} by Epic MegaGames, mostly in the same style, but
with a more typical "action hero". Later games such as {Duke Nukem 3D} are more famous but I have played this
one a lot. Maybe I have played the rest of the trilogy later, but I do not remember anything about them.

GAME Duke Nukem II
BY Apogee Software
VAL year=1993 shareware played=1999 platformer hscroll vscroll realtime sideview shareware pc scifi xp=3 military fixed lores multiweapon exp shooter secrets=?
A sequel to {Duke Nukem}. More interesting because of featuring multiple weapons, one of which could be
also used as jetpack. But I have played it much later, when I was no longer very interested in such games.

GAME Kingdom of Kroz
BY Apogee Software
VAL year=1987 shareware played=2023 ascii realtime topdown shareware pc xp=1 abstract fixed seq combat
Notable for introducing the concept of "shareware trilogy", and for being an example of a game inspired by {Rogue}
made by someone who considered the procedural generation to be its weakness. Simplistic compared to Rogue, 
and the enemies move in real-time, so not very interesting to a roguelike fan.

GAME NetWars
VAL year=1993 played=1995 pc fpp scifi xp=1 shooter multiplayer camscroll vectorart fixed realtime
A demo game created by Novell (a company specializing in PC networks in the 90s) to demonstrate the network capabilities.
You fly a spaceship and shoot other network players. People were playing it on various trips and in schools quite 
actively, possibly I have played it too, but I do not remember.

GAME Xargon
BY Epic
VAL year=1994 played=1997 realtime platformer hscroll vscroll shareware overworld xp=3 sideview fixed lores exp pyramids
Yet another shareware trilogy by Epic MegaGames. Not as interesting as {Jill of the Jungle}, much more generic.

GAME Xonix
VAL pc year=1984 xp=2 played=1994 pc topdown realtime xp=2 abstract shapegfx seq randomized realtime dodger
I think I have played it at some point, but I played {Zolyx} first.

GAME SkyRoads
VAL pc realtime vscroll year=1993 played=1997 platformer tpp scifi fixed xp=1 models picklevel autoscroll
A platformer with weird sci-fi theme (a jumping spaceship??) and perspective like in the Starwars intro.

GAME Summer Challenge
BY Apogee Software
VAL pc year=1996 played=1997 sports multigenre moderntheme fpp fixed xp=2 minigames photorealistic realtime multiplayer
A game simulating various olympic sports.

GAME Lemmings
BY DMA Design
VAL pc year=1991 played=1992 gem=2 weirdtheme animaltheme hscroll destructible pixelsim xp=4 sideview platformer fixed lores pauseable army traps
One of games that were big at some point, but have basically perfected the concept, so they did not start new genres.
A bunch of "lemmings" are going across the level, and you can give abilities to them so that they could reach the goal.
I have played this quite a lot. I remember the password system to be quite weird, the password seemed to depend on the
number of lemmings saved in levels so far (but the game did not seem to react to extra lemmings saved otherwise).

GAME Christmas Lemmings
BY DMA Design
VAL pc year=1992 played=1994 weirdtheme animaltheme destructible pixelsim hscroll xp=3 sideview platformer fixed lores pauseable army traps=?
{Lemmings} but with new levels and a Christmas theme.

GAME Lemmings II: The Tribes
BY DMA Design
VAL pc year=1993 played=1994 weirdtheme animaltheme hscroll vscroll destructible pixelsim xp=4 sideview platformer fixed lores nonlinear pauseable army traps=?
A sequel to {Lemmings}. While in Lemmings we had mixed levels with graphics of various themes, 
here we have 12 separate 'tribes', each with its own theme. There are lots of abilities, instead of just 10 from the
original, and also the levels are larger. In each tribe, the number of lemmings you have equals the number of lemmings saved in the previous level,
and to win the whole game, you have to save most lemmings in every tribe; I do not think this was a good design
decision -- if you solve a level poorly, you can continue with only one lemming, but not much point to do that since
you will have to redo these levels anyway. Independent levels are better for such puzzles.

GAME Lemmings 3D
VAL pc year=1994 played=1995 weirdtheme animaltheme fpp gem=2 destructible xp=2 fixed models seq pauseable army
Yet another sequel to {Lemmings} which is fully 3D. I enjoyed the demo but I have not proceeded to playing the full version.
I think it should get more credit for being an early blocky 3D game with destructible terrain (much later popularized by Infiniminer and {Minecraft}).
It is more in the style of original {Lemmings} than {Lemmings II: The Tribes}, with independent levels and a low number of abilities (only one
3D-specific ability was added, 'turner').

GAME Bananoid
VAL pc year=1989 played=1991 realtime physics xp=4 sideview fixed vectorart notheme hscroll
An {Arkanoid} clone with banana displayed for some weird reason, not very good one.

GAME Alley Cat
VAL pc year=1983 played=1994 realtime animaltheme=2 gem=2 platformer minigames xp=2 sideview randomized lores
A game where you play as a cat. You start on a street, you have to enter a window; inside, you have to perform one of possible missions, which would
be mostly platformer-ish but also some other genres. Good variety and very fun.

GAME Jimmy White's Snooker
VAL pc year=1991 played=1995 physics fpp turnbased gambletheme shooter moderntheme xp=2 fixed shapegfx camscroll multiplayer=?
A first-person simulation of {Snooker}, with some funny idle graphics.

GAME Rack'em
VAL pc year=1988 played=1995 physics topdown turnbased gambletheme shooter moderntheme lores shapegfx xp=2 fixed minigames multiplayer=?
A simulation of {Eight-ball pool}, {Snooker}, and some other games. Sometimes your shot would miss (I think that was because of "beginner" and "pro"
which were not difficulty levels but rather a selection of how skilled the simulated player is, but I could be wrong).

GAME Scorched Earth
VAL pc year=1991 played=1993 physics turnbased shooter free gem=2 military xp=4 sideview multiweapon pixelsim destructible procgen randomized seq lores multiplayer ammolimit
An artillery game that was quite popular, and I liked it more than {Worms} which became popular later.
The tanks were mostly static, but they would fall (using parachutes) if the terrain beneath them was
destroyed; you could also buy fuel to move them. Lots of possible fun weapons, shields, etc.
Very configurable. (Technically shareware game, I have played only the free version, the differences in the paid version did not seem substantial.)

GAME Heroes of Might and Magic II
VAL pc year=1996 played=1998 turnbased grid medieval xp=2 diagrid hexgrid topdown fixed seq hscroll vscroll lores rpgstats multiplayer exp combat modalbattle manualsave leveleditor=? difflevels
A good game, but {Heroes of Might and Magic III} was better. HoMM2 had a bit less fun design (you could only have 5 unit stacks in your army, 
while your castles produced 6), less upgradeable units, less interesting artifacts, etc.

GAME Warlords
VAL pc year=1990 played=1995 turnbased grid medieval xp=4 orthogrid topdown army fixed hscroll vscroll lores rpgstats multiplayer=? exp combat
A game combining strategy (mostly castles producing units) and RPG/fantasy elements (you had special units called 'heroes' who could explore
ruins on the map to find allies or collect artifacts,
most notably raising their 'leadership' stat, that is, raising the power of all units in the same army). It had only one map, so not much
game there. In general, not as good as the later {Heroes of Might and Magic III}, although it could still be played from time to time.

GAME Warlords II
VAL pc year=1997 played=1998 turnbased grid medieval xp=4 orthogrid topdown army fixed randomized hscroll vscroll lores rpgstats multiplayer=? exp combat
Similar to {Warlords} but better. It was clearly explained which units have which power. There were more maps, and also randomized maps were available.
Heroes could get experience to further increase their power. The units were quite fun, you could also buy an ability to produce new units in cities.

GAME Heroes of Might and Magic III
VAL pc year=1999 played=2000 turnbased grid gem=2 medieval xp=3 diagrid hexgrid topdown fixed seq hscroll vscroll lores models rpgstats multiplayer exp combat modalbattle manualsave leveleditor difflevels
This game was a big hit in Poland, but seems rarely discussed eleswehere. A combination of strategy game (tactical hex grid battles, resource management
via capturing mines and upgrading town structures) and some RPG/fantasy elements (exploration of a fantasy map, stats, spellcasting).
The heroes act as commanders, they do not fit by themselves. Could be played hotseat (I played only cooperatively). Still has mods created.
I have played all the campaigns.

GAME Heroes of Might and Magic V
VAL pc year=2006 played=2006 turnbased grid medieval diagrid topdown fixed seq arbi3 models rpgstats xp=2 exp combat modalbattle manualsave=? multiplayer
Not nearly as good as {Heroes of Might and Magic III}. Somehow did not capture me. Needless 3D graphics, especially annoying that the attack animations
could not be disabled. The hex tactical map of HoMM3 has been replaced with squares, with large units (such as horses) taking 2x2 squares, that was
not as cool. Heroes could fight in this one.

GAME Atlantis
BY Soleau Software
VAL pc year=1990 played=1996 turnbased greek army topdown xp=4 randomized tiny difflevels vectorart multiplayer=? grid arbigrid
A simple computer implementation of the classic boardgame {Risk} (with some modification). Fixed graph map, extra armies for conquering the whole continents,
ancient Greek theme. You just moved numbers between regions, fun, but nothing special.

GAME Betrayal at Krondor
VAL pc year=1993 played=1997 tolkien xp=3 fpp exp fixed seq openworld modalbattle photorealistic lores turnbased traps riddles nonlinear intrapower=?
A rather interesting RPG, made in collaboration with the writer Raymond Feist. 3D open world, interesting to explore. Treasures found in chests protected by
passwords. Turn-based grid-based battles, of course not nearly as good as in roguelikes. Used photos of actors for PCs and NPCs, which clashed with the
simple 3D backgrounds a bit, so I did not like that aspect much.

GAME Settlers II
BY Blue Byte
BY country: Germany
VAL pc year=1993 played=1996 medieval xp=3 isometric army realtime lores hscroll vscroll seq economy fixed multiplayer
An early city simulation game. Gather resources like wood, stones, and coal, construct buildings, produce military units and towers, fight enemy units,
with a campaign, and an interesting option to play PvP on a single computer, each player using their own mouse.

GAME Settlers III
BY Blue Byte
BY country: Germany
VAL pc year=1998 played=1999 medieval army realtime economy models hscroll vscroll seq fixed xp=3 arbi3 manualsave=?
An extended version of {Settlers II}. Less grid-based, nicer graphics, you could play as one of three nations, some cutscenes, ships. From the campaign,
I mostly remember a scenario "capture a tower", that tower was quite near but it seemed difficult to capture, so I had an idea that the correct way to
capture the tower was to weaken the enemy first by attacking them from behind. So I conquered the enemy, conquered the unsupported tower, and in the next
scenario, the goal was to capture the rest (which I have already captured?).

GAME Knights and Merchants
VAL pc year=1998 played=1999 medieval army realtime economy models hscroll vscroll seq fixed=? xp=1 topdown
A game similar to {Settlers III}, I have played a demo of this, I did not feel anything special about it. I think it had more interesting food system,
the units had to take breaks to eat from time to time, and it was good to have more varied food, as then, they ate less often.

GAME Craft
VAL pc year=1997 played=1998 medieval army realtime lores hscroll vscroll procgen xp=2 topdown multiplayer exp combat gem=1 randomized
This game seems to be hard to find nowadays... blame the extremely unspecific name, I guess? It was an open source RTS game that could be found
in Debian Linux software repositories in the 90s. It was a very simple RTS with a few units of usual kinds: peasants, swordmen, archers, and catapults.
However it had some interesting features that were not in other RTS games of this time. You could put your units on ships, and then they would
affect the military power of the ship in obvious ways (catapults and archers would shoot, swordsmen would attack when trying to board an enemy ship).
The peasants could increase or decrease the height of fragments of the map, you could use that to create fortifications or moats. Unfortunately, while
I found these aspect interesting, it was not really possible to experience them (no predesigned scenarios where you attacked enemy forts or defended
yourself, only a very basic AI that did nothing of these things). You could play against a human of course, but I have not tried to convince anyone
to play that simple game.

GAME Crossfire
VAL pc year=1993 played=1998 medieval roguelike xp=1 topdown exp grid diagrid fixed procgen randomized nonlinear hscroll vscroll lores multiplayer realtime traps=? secrets=? nonlinear intrapower
This game appeared in early roguelike lists, although it is not really a traditional one, having a real-time element, and not that focused on
randomization. Could be played against other people. I think I was not very successful in it, and did not play much.

I got a demo of this game together with {Settlers II}. One interesting element of this RPG is its world, combining science-fiction elements
with fantasy -- your spaceship crashes on an alien world working similar to medieval fantasy, although not with the typical 
elves and dragons, but with aliens such as cat-like Iskai who could wield daggers in their tails. Very nice world-building and magic-versus-technology
story. CRPG book says it is similar thematically to the movie <i>Avatar</i>, I think that is a good comparison.
The battles are turn-based grid-tactical, but I found the system rather strange: at the start of your turn you give orders to all your units,
then these orders are executed in the order of initiative -- so units with lower initiative would not actually hit their targets, because they had
probably moved in the meantime!

GAME Faery Tale Adventure II
AKA FTA2
VAL pc year=1997 played=1997 isometric medieval xp=3 exp rpgstats rpgequip rpgconsume rpgquests fixed openworld lores realtime manualsave secrets gem=2 nonlinear return
An early isometric action RPG, from about the same time as {Diablo}, but different. Contrary to Diablo and {Son of the Empire}, it featured
a beautiful open world which was quite interesting to explore, even if the game was clearly released in an unfinished state. 
Also an interesting system of inventory that included "mental" inventory, containing
concepts (things you could talk about with NPCs), skills, and spells. I had experimented with diving into the files, finding a 'cheat' area, 
I think I have even guessed somehow that giving an oil lamp to a specific character would give me access to the cheat area?
I have seen it compared to {Ultima} VIII, although I have not played this.

I have first heard of Legend of Zelda in 1999 or so, after buying an ocarina and trying to ask the Internet "how to play an ocarina", and
finding the tutorials for "Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time". So when I found a game named 'zelda' included with a gameboy emulator, 
I checked it out to see what {Zelda} actually was. I found it to be a nice metroidvania-ish game -- ability-gated exploration, but mostly
using the top-down perspective. Mostly -- I found it very interesting how occassionally you got into sideview areas, an inspiration for
the platformer levels in {HyperRogue}.

I think I have found a demo of this game on a CD from a friend (together with some other games). A very good RPG with nice tactical system,
with a bit of roguelike feel, but with six characters in your party, and action-point-based. One of the selling points was that the world would
change if you acted too slowly -- the enemies would overrun the people -- although this acted mostly as a way to be careful about timing,
you could still explore the whole map in the time limit. And there were lots to explore, and I have played it (and {Avernum III}) many times.

GAME Warcraft

VAL pc tolkien year=1994 played=1995 tolkien xp=3 topdown army realtime economy fixed seq lores multiplayer exp combat multicampaign manualsave
This was the first RTS ({Dune II} clone) I have played -- in particular, I have played it before {Dune II} which is usually considered the start of the modern
RTS genre, and also RTS-ish but somewhat different {Settlers II}. Warcraft and Dune II are quite similar; I liked Warcraft more (due to its fantasy
setting -- Dune II was my first encounter with the Dune franchise, and while the original Dune book is a sci-fi world-building classic for
a good reason, the game felt more like "some tanks on a desert" -- it had typical battle scenarios as well as ones taking part in the
dungeons, which I found an interesting combination). It was nice to proceed to further scenarios and have more and more units available,
eventually reaching the powerful water elemental and demons. Contrary to more modern RTS games such as Starcraft, the Human and Orc campaigns were two
separate campaigns -- they were similar in the general idea, but differed in details. It was quite interesting that the game seemed unbalanced:
the most noticeable difference between humans and orcs was that the Human archer reach was 1 square longer than the Orcish spearman (making the battles
easier as having a row of archers covered by a front row of swordsmen mostly worked), and that Humans could cast healing spells (using cleric mana that
automatically replenished), while Orcs were wounded permanently -- they stayed wounded until they died, after which their Cleric analogs could animate
very weak and slow skeletons. Was Orcs a hard mode or something? (I do not think it was explained anywhere.) Somehow in the sequels the canon was that
the Orcs won, which seemed weird, given that they were weaker.

A point-and-click game based on a popular Polish comic series (a bit similar in style to Asterix). Not that good, it had some design flaws:
I believe it let you go without return to new places without having collected all the necessary things in the previous place; 
there was some pixel hunting; and it had a power glove said to be usable only three times, but you actually use it more times. Nice to control two

it was a game best played following a walkthrough closely -- some of the puzzles seemed impossible to solve (various parts would be spread over the whole
game world, which was huge; or puzzles like approaching a certain skeleton in a specific way when there were tons of skeletons everywhere which were just
a decoration), with some annoying design, like some hints being accessible only if you had a specific item equipped (and you could equip only 
some of them). Which would leave only platforming and some feeling of exploring mysterious ruins. Although I have seen some people saying that it was much more
fun to play without a walkthrough.

The RTS genre was famously started by the game called {Dune II}... so what about Dune I? Well, I think Dune I is worth playing too.
It is a rather unique game, that feels like something between a strategy game and adventure. You capture territories and move your units between
them, just like usual in strategy games. But you also play as a character (Paul Atreides) doing basic adventure stuff: contacting people, proceeding
along a storyline, generally much more heavily based on the book than Dune II. While both aspects are much more simple than 'pure' strategy and 'pure'

Basically a jigsaw puzzle, but the image is animated! In the mode I have been playing it in, you have limited time to solve the puzzles, and the puzzles become
more and more complicated (more pieces and more moving elements). There 9 images, which were not realistic movies, but rather mathematically generated animations.
I think it could still be fun to modern players, or maybe an updated game based on the same idea could be created. One problem was that a big part of my strategy was
basically try to put pieces on the board and connect them randomly until a connection formed (if you place two matching pieces correctly next to each other, they
immediately become permanently connected), and repeat until the whole puzzle is solved. It just seemed more productive (given the limited time) to do that than to
think. I thought that it could be more fun played by a team of two players -- one focusing to thinking, the other focused on controlling the mouse (and thus trying
random combos unless given hints by the other player) -- but I have never played it that way. Probably the design could be improved to avoid that.

A game about simulating an evolution of a species, from a single cell to a spacefaring race. Various stages are games of very different genres. Unfortunately the
model of evolution is totally not realistic -- I have read that they wanted it to be realistic at first, but it was just not fun. Although what you did in the early stages does not seem to
matter than much in the later ones. It is nice how the later stages are foreshadowed in the earlier ones, for example you see aliens abducting your people, and then you do the same thing,
basically becoming that alien. The spacefaring stage seems to be the crowning, longest part of the game, unfortunately it felt rather boring to me, there is lots of procgen stuff to be done in
the universe, and somehow you do all of it alone. So, definitely an interesting and ambitious game, but ultimately not that fun.

Spelunky is the game that tried to capture the feeling of a roguelike
in a platformer setting, and did it very well, one of rare action games where procedurally-generated permadeath makes it more fun. It is unfortunate that it has inspired {The Binding of Isaac}
which created its own genre that is much more boring. The "changing room" that inverts the common trope is great, and missing from {Spelunky HD}. (It seems to be not remembered
that much recently, so I give it a bit of gem score.)

just playing the game (with various modes represented as doors), while in Spelunky HD it is a boring menu.

VAL scifi female year=1986 xp=0 female scifi sideview platformer flick hscroll vscroll ability return sideview nonlinear bossfights realtime fixed lores exp
I have not played the original Metroid, only {Super Metroid}. I feel its influence is a bit overrated, though.

I have played many non-linear exploration adventures on my Amstrad CPC: {Chuckie Egg II}, {Hero of the Golden Talisman}, {Pyjamarama}, 
{Cauldron II}, {Antiriad}, and so on. The modern metroidvania can be interpreted as a natural evolution of this design. While it did
happen to evolve from Metroid, it would probably evolve as well without Metroid. These old games may have worse ability gating than
Metroid, but then, old games did lack character progression in general. (Also the developers of both Metroid and {Castlevania: Symphony of the Night}
are to have took their ability gating from {Legend of Zelda}, so zeldalike might be a better name.)

It is also one commonly given as an example of an early game with female character. But it should not really count, she is wearing
her suit all the time, and undressing is just a reward, it is more like strip poker. Why not play {Saboteur II} instead.

But console franchises do lots of marketing while computer games tend to be forgotten.

GAME Europa Universalis II
BY Paradox
BY country: Sweden
VAL year=2001 played=2005 history pauseable xp=2 topdown exp combat xxxx fixed vscroll hscroll openworld army economy grid arbigrid hires nonlinear
A grand strategy game that attempts to recreate the history in the years 1419-1820, with actual historical people and events. Despite "Europa" in the name, the whole world is represented,
so you can play, for example, as China as well.

It is definitely an interesting design, but of course the player will generally make different decisions than what the actual historical leader did, possibly making the world in the game
very different than the actual world. This would in turn affect the people and events. For example, a historical scientist from the real world could simply die instead if there was a war in
the game world that did not exist in the real world. Or if the war did exist only in the real world, a person that died in the war could instead survive in the the game world and change it.
I think I have spent more time reading the script files describing the events than witnessing them in the actual game, but 
I did not feel that such consequences were modelled well (it would be of course very hard to do so, I have no idea how it could be done).
I think a similar game where people and events are procedurally generated based on the specifics of the game world (although possibly loosely inspired by actual history) would be interesting.

GAME Miegakure
VAL year=? xp=0 spacebending notheme fpp realtime logic=? sciencegame seq=? fixed=? models gem=-1
A four-dimensional game that is in development since 2009, with lots of hype, although that hype has died down recently. As far as I understand, an early demo has been shown on some
gaming festivals and got praised by some people who were very popular at that time, such as Jonathan Blow. But from the looks of it, the basic idea was about crossing
the walls using the fourth dimension, which should be nothing new for people who read the classic novel <i>Flatland</i>. Basically a somewhat trivial consequence of something that
looks like advanced mathematics. So I do not expect that the finished game would be actually good, but I would love to be proven wrong.
It can be compared to {Hyperbolica} which I did not expect to be that a good game because it appeared to be care only about advanced math but not much about good gameplay
(and the reviews support this view), as opposed to {4D Golf} or {4D Miner}, which looked like they had actual ideas for good games based on the concept of 4D, and seem to be well received.

Also the developer appears to be a rather weird person, with some creepy stories about him, and blocking developers who make similar games.

I did not expect it to be a good game because the development blogs only focused on tech and it was not even clear what genre it was supposed to be. And I still have not played it.
As far as I understand, it is a walking simulator with some mini-games included, based on various genres. It appears most of that existed in {HyperRogue} before Hyperbolica was even
announced (HyperRogue also includes 3D non-Euclidean graphics and experiments with various genres in non-Euclidean geometry -- 
these experiments did not turn out as good as the original roguelike gameplay so they were not fleshed out).
The reviews are not that great (the main game is a walking simulator and the genre experiments also were not fleshed out, people seem to want more gameplay), 
also the Steam description appeared to
be misleading, that the game has a larger world or more focus on puzzles. But it looks to be a good game if you want a hyperbolic walking simulator with somewhat realistic graphics

SPOILER about the story
There are many interpretations of the story, but the obvious one is that Tim is a stalker who sees the world differently, he sees himself as a hero while he is in fact a villain,
as bad people actually do. Braid is a nice artistic take on this phenomenon, and a caution against making up your opinions about conflicts based on what only one side says.

A very old shareware game that feels a bit like reverse {Tetris}: tetromino-shaped pipes fall from above and want to crush our mole. But they eventually land on the floor and
other pipes, and the mole can also just eat them if it approaches them from the correct direction. Still fun in 2025. Sometimes the pipes just disappear randomly, which is
annoying if it causes the mole to be crushed because of the structural damage to the whole structure. The pipes are generated randomly, sometimes it is clear that the generator
is not based on the obvious model (there is an infinite number of pipes above, higher and higher, placed randomly, and they just fall down -- sometimes one or two columns
infinitely produce new pipes when according to the obvious model that situation should be blocked by a pipe laying on the adjacent columns), it would be interesting to see
if creating a better generator would be possible.

A free spacebending game. The idea is that you have a three-dimensional world that you can explore, which is obviously projected to the 2D computer screen, as usual in a first-person game.
But the main game takes part in this 2D view, which you can "lock" and play like a platformer. And later look at it from another point of view and continue. A similar idea appears in
the later stages of {The Witness}, but Perspective was earlier. (There are also other similarities, like pipes which connect the various puzzles and lighten up and continue to the
next puzzle when the current one is solved -- I guess The Witness took inspiration, or maybe they both took inspiration from the same source.) Very cool, more fun than The Witness IMO,
even if short. I know that the devs later created the game {Superliminal}.

not surprising (it does feel weird and you can find yourself in essentially the same place as before but with changed gravity), although the space is totally the Euclidean space --
the main mechanics is basically copy-paste a prism-shaped region from one spot to another. Very cool that this game was created, although we did not find it that interesting to play.

whole city that hosts it, and you have a mission to slay the leader of the opposing one.

Yet another take on "{Doom} but as a different genre", this time it is a 2D platformer. As with the other Doom fangames, it is free, and it is nice to see how Doom can be adapted to a different
genre. I did not find it that good, though.

GAME Revenge of the Titans
VAL year=2010 played=2012 xp=3 scifi aliens topdown realtime defense fixed seq hscroll vscroll lores
A tower defense game that was included in one of early Humble Bundles. It was quite good, although nothing special.

GAME Osmos
VAL year=2009 played=2012 shapegfx xp=3 bacteria topdown realtime fixed seq collectathon
Another game included in one of early Humble Bundles. A simple indie game, you are a circular blob, you can eat other circular blobs if they are smaller, getting bigger as a result. 
Some blobs have (anti?-)gravity, so being close to them is dangerous if you are not big enough yet yourself. It was fun and rather unique, but I do not remember much.

Another game included in one of early Humble Bundles. This time you are a soft body blob, and doing platformer-like stuff. I do not remember much.

GAME Canabalt

The game that popularized the infinite runner genre. A platformer where you just run, for as long as possible, without falling.

GAME Night of the Full Moon

Mostly a clone of {Dream Quest}, but without the roguelike-like map structure, and with nice graphics.

I technically played on iOS, but it would be silly to create a tag for just one game.

GAME Fire Emblem

I have not played this, I have played {Battle for Wesnoth} which is supposedly similar.

GAME Starcraft

VAL year=1998 played=2000 xp=3 scifi isometric realtime army economy combat defense fixed seq multiplayer multicampaign models leveleditor manualsave
A great real-time strategy game. I have played both the original and Broodwars DLC.
The first game I have played with a "modern" campaign, where you play the three campaigns sequentially (instead of taking one side to win), and with actually exciting twists.

GAME Duke Nukem 3D

I have played this multiplayer. Fun, but not much to say about it.

GAME Manic Miner PC
VAL year=1998 played=1999 pc fpp xp=2 sideview realtime platformer lores weirdtheme fixed seq collectathon free
A very good remake of {Manic Miner}. While 'modern graphics' remakes often look bad, this one is tasteful: the sprites are colored but
they do not have 3D effects, higher resolution, or anything. The music has been updated to, and there is an alternative set of levels
(which is interesting because all the enemies are in the same spots are the original, but they still managed to make the levels feel very different!).

GAME Mario

BY country: Japan
VAL console year=1985 played=2000 sideview realtime platformer lores notheme fixed seq xp=1 exp secrets
I have not played this series much. But somehow Nintendo pushes this game as something that should be known to everyone, while around here, Nintendo games basically did not exist.
Early non-console platformers such as {Manic Miner}, {Jet Set Willy}, or even {Commander Keen} should be talked about more! (Even though Mario games were an inspiration for them.)

GAME Zelda

BY country: Japan
VAL console year=1986 played=2024 xp=1 medieval topdown realtime exp combat fixed flick lores ability
Another early game that is pushed by Nintendo as something that should be known to everyone, while there were lots of similar 8-bit games. For example, there is lots about how
Zelda was the game that introduced saving, while it introducing saves on consoles, while computer games such as {Rogue} and {Chuckie Egg} had saves long before!

GAME CD-Man

Basically a clone of {Pacman}, with various levels having different graphics. I do not think I have progressed far, though.

GAME The Spirit Engine II
VAL year=2008 played=2015 pc onedim turnbased xp=3 fixed free combat medieval lovecraftian=? hscroll return=? midres
A free RPG with {jRPG}-inspired combat. I have seen someone recommend this free RPG and it looked interesting.
The gameplay is mostly one-dimensional, you explore levels from left to right, sometimes you fight. Contrary
to a typical {jRPG} where you have predefined characters, in TSE you are free to pick your own character
(from the list of 9), and the game builds the story about them (there are three "roles" in the story and you
should pick a character for every role). Quite good, although I of course prefer more roguelike-ish combat.

TAG onedim I think it deserves onedim because you explore levels from left to right, like in a sidescroller, and the order of placement of both parties in combat matters.

GAME Time4Cat
VAL web year=2009 xp=2 played=2025 dodger collectathon topdown tiny pauseable roguelike moderntheme animaltheme=2 randomized free midres
A Flash (?) game in which you are a cat controlling the flow of time, and you collect food while evading pedestrians. It has some similarities to roguelikes
(you control time, top-down perspective, maybe not Rogue-style procgen but randomized enemy patterns) but I do not know whether there was any inspiration. A nice cat theme.
This game was an inspiration to {Superhot}.

GAME Crusher
BY Soleau Software
VAL year=1991 played=1993 pc topdown lores boulderdash moderntheme randomized xp=4 realtime flick
A shareware game, the most of it is randomized maps created out of square blocks, there are some enemies, you push the blocks to trap the enemies.
The game is real-time but the grid movement is instant.
There are also some special rooms in which you find special events for the storyline.

GAME Red
VAL year=2007 played=2007 web sideview shapegfx uniquegfx physics shooter dodger scifi randomized xp=3 realtime seq
A Flash game a bit reminiscent of {Missile Command}. This time your rockets do not explode, but they are balls, the approaching enemies are also balls, and
you shoot them to bounce them off. Quite interesting.

GAME Gun Run
VAL year=2007 played=2007 web sideview vectorart uniquegfx shooter hscroll autoscroll scifi randomized=? xp=3 realtime
A Flash game I remember the most, although I mostly remember the graphical style (black silhouettes on sunset-like background) rather than the gameplay (which was mostly
running in a straight line and shooting, as the name suggests).

GAME Literaxx

VAL year=2002 xp=0 web nonvideo wordgame abstract topdown turnbased randomized tiny

It started as a {Scrabble} clone (with a somewhat different board) but then they changed the rules a bit. It was extremely popular in Poland. As a spinoff, they
also created a Polish dictionary for word games that {Seuphorica} is using. I am not sure whether I have played myself, but I have watched a friend playing it,
apparently the person he was playing against was in the same lab, and he was using an automated dictionary.

GAME Pan
BY Poland
BY maf
VAL year=2001? xp=0 web nonvideo cardgame abstract topdown turnbased randomized tiny
A very popular card game of Polish origin; there was an online version of Kurnik, which this entry mostly refers to. The number of states was small enough that
it was easy to write a computer program playing it optimally; I have watched such a bot, commenting on the human opponents' errors (like, they were losing in 100 moves,
but only 50 moves after a grave error!). I do not think I have actually played the online version, only the physical card one, and I did not like it.
(It does not seem to appear on the English version of Kurnik.)

GAME Kalambury

BY maf
AKA Pictionary
VAL year=2004 played=2000 xp=2 web nonvideo wordgame abstract sideview realtime riddles engineering randomized tiny
One player tries to "draw" a secret word or phrase, and the other players try to guess it.
This refers to the Kurnik version that seemed extremely popular in Poland. According to Wikipedia it was released in 2004, although maf did show something very similar to me in 2000,
and also I have played the nonvideo version where you show the secret word by body movements earlier. (It does not seem to appear on the English version of Kurnik.)
